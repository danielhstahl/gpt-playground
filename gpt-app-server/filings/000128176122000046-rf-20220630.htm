Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that the actual
effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those
forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are
uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the
scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the impact of
additional variants and resurgences), the effectiveness, availability and
acceptance of any vaccines or therapies, and the direct and indirect impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, third parties and us. Forward-looking
statements are not based on historical information, but rather are related to
future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.
Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations as
well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available
to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based
on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also
relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the
views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we
caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These
risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those
described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of any pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the
global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair
the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance
for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or
additional expenses.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law,
which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return
capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as
changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by
applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of
the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress,
and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require
us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our
revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our
businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum
capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and
must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by
our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to
shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our businesses.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses, including our recently completed acquisitions of EnerBank, Sabal,
and Clearsight, and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the
expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not
be realized within the expected timeframes, or might be less than projected;
difficulties in integrating the businesses; and the inability of Regions to
effectively cross-sell products following these acquisitions.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses,
such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and
other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach
of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act
or failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our businesses on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and frequency of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of

6

Table of Contents

  

commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans
outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or
damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our
reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions
Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of anti-takeover and exclusive forum laws and provision in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

  

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

"Risk Factors" section of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 479 at December 31, 2021, to 1,652 at June 30,
2022. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2021 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss represented credit impairment as of those dates.
The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of
their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is presented below.
Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale were immaterial for the three months ended June 30, 2022
and the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The cost of securities sold
is based on the specific identification method. As part of the Company's
normal process for evaluating impairment, management did not identify any
positions where impairment was believed to exist in either of the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate and consumer.
Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to Note 5
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 for information regarding Regions' portfolio segments
and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal
banking regulators' definitions and are utilized to develop the associated
allowance. Refer to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for information regarding
commercial risk ratings.

Regions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique
credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices
and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio.
FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal
underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans.
Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for
various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an
updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop
the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less
probability of default and vice versa.

The following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, by vintage year
as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Classes in the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes
in the consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer
to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2021 for more information regarding Regions'
credit quality indicators.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 5
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding the Company's
TDRs, including their impact on the allowance and designation of TDRs in
periods subsequent to the modification.

As provided initially in the CARES Act and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, certain loan modifications related to the
COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief were not considered TDRs and are excluded from the 2021 disclosures
below.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value

________

(1)Purchases of residential MSRs can be structured with cash hold back
provisions, therefore the timing of payment may be made in future periods.

(2)Includes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR
decay methodology is a discounted net cash flow approach.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| June 30  
| 2022| | 2021  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 52,965 | | | $| 35,519 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 7.9 | %| | 10.5 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (66)| | | $| (27)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (107)| | | $| (49)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 480| | 571 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (17)| | | $| (9)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (34)| | | $| (19)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.4 | %| | 3.7 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 309| | 292  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.1 | | | 27.3 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

Servicing related fees, which includes contractually specified servicing fees,
late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of
residential mortgage loans totaled $28 million and $25 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively and $55 million and $49
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

Regions periodically evaluates the commercial MSRs for impairment based on
fair value. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs was approximately
$109 million at June 30, 2022 and $96 million at December 31, 2021.

Servicing related fees, which includes contractually specified servicing fees,
late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of
commercial mortgage loans totaled $7 million and $5 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively and $14 million and $10
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Board declared a total of $41 million in cash dividends on Series B,
Series C and Series D preferred stock during both the first six months of 2022
and 2021. The Board declared cash dividends of $8 million on Series E
preferred stock for the first six months of 2022; the initial quarterly
dividend on Series E was declared in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally,
total cash dividends for the first six months of 2021 includes $16 million in
cash dividends on Series A preferred stock, which were fully redeemed during
the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, a total of $49 million in cash
dividends on total preferred stock was declared in the first six months of
2022 compared to the total of $57 million in cash dividends on total preferred
stock for the same period in 2021.

In the event Series B, Series C, Series D or Series E preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $67 million, $10 million, $4 million, or
$10 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to common shareholders'
equity. The remaining amounts listed represent issuance costs that were
recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will
be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

As a result of Regions' voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR, effective
October 1, 2021, Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2021
through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent. On June 27,
2022, Regions announced the Company received the results of the 2022 stress
test from the FRB, reflecting that the Company exceeded all minimum capital
levels and inclusive of a preliminary SCB floored at 2.5 percent. On August 4,
2022, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement, and as a result for the
fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 the SCB requirement
will continue to be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's 2021 capital plan, the Board authorized the
repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
During the three months ended March 31, 2022, Regions repurchased
approximately 9.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $215
million and concluded the plan in the first quarter of 2022. All of these
shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not
included in treasury stock.

of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of
2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of June 30, 2022, Regions had
repurchased approximately 725 thousand shares of common stock at a total cost
of $15 million under this plan. All of these shares were immediately retired
upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock.

The Board declared a cash dividend for both the first and second quarter of
2022 for $0.17 per share, totaling $0.34 per common share for the first six
months of 2022 as compared to $0.155 per common share for the same periods of

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Includes no accrued interest at June 30, 2022 and $12 million at December
31, 2021.

(3)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements, and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions also enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate prepayable and non-prepayable debt securities available for sale. These
agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-
rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swaps, floors, and agreements with a
combination of these instruments to manage overall cash flow changes related
to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate loans. The agreements
effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing
receive fixed/pay LIBOR or SOFR interest rate swaps and interest rate floors.
As of June 30, 2022, Regions is hedging its exposure to the variability in
future cash flows through 2029.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to-market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Regions had $331 million and $419
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
Regions had $524 million and $987 million, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage
income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and
corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans
are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $3.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2022 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2022 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of June 30, 2022 was approximately $426 million. This scenario would occur if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at June 30, 2022 and
2021 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were $99 million and $81 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $113 million and $84
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis:

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

Commercial mortgage loans held for sale

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
commercial mortgage loans held for sale are credit spreads for bonds in
commercial mortgage-backed securitization. Commercial mortgage loans held for
sale are valued based on traded market prices for comparable commercial
mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted
for movements of interest rates and credit spreads. Increases or decreases in
credit spreads would result in an inverse impact to fair value.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

As discussed above, the Company elected the option to measure certain
commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. At June 30, 2022, the
balance of these loans was immaterial. At December 31, 2021, commercial
mortgage loans held for sale at fair value had both an aggregate fair value
and unpaid principal balance of $90 million.

The Company has elected the option to measure certain commercial and
industrial loans held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively
traded in the secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value
estimates for substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation
service that is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans
are traded in the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject
to variability and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these
loans held for sale was immaterial at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
first mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows
for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the
derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of
complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Fair values of
residential first mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market
prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at
market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include
servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for
sale.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential first mortgage
loans held for sale measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale.
The following table details net gains and losses resulting from changes in
fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale, which were recorded in
mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income during the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. These changes in fair value are
mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these
amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include loans held for
sale for which the fair value option has not been elected, foreclosed property
and other real estate and equity investments without a readily determinable
fair value; all of which may be considered either Level 2 or Level 3 valuation
measurements. Non-recurring fair value adjustments related to loans held for
sale, foreclosed property and other real estate are typically a result of the
application of lower of cost or fair value accounting during the period. Non-
recurring fair value adjustments related to equity investments without readily
determinable fair values are the result of impairments or price changes from
observable transactions. The balances of each of these assets, as well as the
related fair value adjustments during the periods, were immaterial at both
June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within
the fair value hierarchy, of the Company's financial instruments as of June

estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

(2)The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at June 30,
2022 was $3.6 billion or 4.0 percent.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior period was updated to reflect
these enhancements.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 23 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible that Regions could
incur losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
June 30, 2022, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could incur
no losses in excess of amounts accrued. See related discussion with respect to
the CFPB matter described below. As available information changes, the matters
for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves
will be adjusted accordingly.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves

49

Table of Contents

  

legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter
involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or
is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some matters, and the
aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not include an estimate for
every pending matter.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business.

As previously disclosed, Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the
CFPB into certain of Regions' historical overdraft practices and policies.
While Regions believes that its practices and policies at issue are lawful,
Regions has commenced discussions with the CFPB regarding a potential
resolution of the investigation. Regions cannot provide assurance that these
discussions will result in a resolution or that the CFPB will not ultimately
commence legal proceedings seeking civil monetary penalties, restitution or
other relief. Although Regions continues to believe that a loss in excess of
amounts accrued for this matter is reasonably possible, the total amount of
such possible loss or range of possible loss cannot currently be estimated.
However, any possible loss, whether a result of a resolution directly with the
CFPB or legal proceedings, could be material to Regions' results of
operations.

Additional inquiries from such governmental regulatory agencies, law
enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies will arise from time to
time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives document requests,
subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries could develop into
administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that
could result in consequences that have a material effect on Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a
whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments, findings,
settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

While the final outcomes of litigation, claims, investigations and legal and
administrative cases and proceedings are inherently unpredictable, management
is currently of the opinion that the outcomes of pending and threatened
matters will not have a material effect on Regions' business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. However,
in the event of unexpected future developments, it is reasonably possible that
an adverse outcome in any such matter could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a
whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions sells commercial loans to Fannie Mae through the DUS lending program
and through other platforms. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal
balance for the majority of the commercial servicing portfolio. At June 30,
2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled
approximately $4.8 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Regions has
additional loans sold to Fannie Mae outside of the DUS program that are also
subject to a loss share guarantee and at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021
these serviced loans totaled approximately $491 million and $400 million,
respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to
all loans subject to a loss share guarantee was approximately $1.7 billion at
both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company would be liable for this
amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the
Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral
underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of
settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not
representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The
estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a
liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was approximately $7
million at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2021, for additional information.

This Update represents the final amended guidance to the 'last-of-layer' hedge
model for fair value hedge relationships. The last-of-layer method allowed for
essentially a single hedge for a given portfolio of only prepayable assets.

  

The 'portfolio layer' method will make the hedging asset side of the balance
sheet easier as it allows for more flexibility in the use of derivatives and
structures that best align with management's objectives for hedging purposes.
Multiple hedged layers are permitted in fair value hedge relationships for a
closed portfolio of financial assets. Both prepayable and non-prepayable
financial instruments may be used and included.

  

The Update permits reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity
to available-for-sale upon adoption with restrictions. Portfolio layer method
hedging must be applied to those debt securities. Also, the decision to
reclassify must be within 30 days after the date of adoption, and securities
would need to be included in a closed portfolio that is designed in a
portfolio layer method hedge within that 30-day period.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K. See
Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements"
to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of
this discussion will be on the three and six months ended June 30, 2022
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 for the consolidated
statements of income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of
this discussion will be the balances as of June 30, 2022 compared to December
31, 2021.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 6 through 8 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. In addition, Regions operates
several offices delivering specialty capabilities in New York, Washington
D.C., Chicago and other locations nationwide. Regions provides financial
solutions for a wide range of clients including retail and mortgage banking
services, commercial banking services and wealth and investment services.
Further, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including
merger and acquisition advisory services, capital market solutions, home
improvement lending and others.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At June 30, 2022, Regions operated 1,294 total branch outlets. Regions
carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable
business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with
the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment Information" to the
consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions'
segment reporting structure.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

On December 17, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Clearsight
Advisors, Inc., a leading-edge mergers and acquisitions firm headquartered in
McLean, Virginia. The transaction closed on December 31, 2021.

On October 4, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital
Partners, LLC, a diversified financial services firm that facilitates lending
in the small-balance commercial real estate market headquartered in Irvine,
California. The transaction closed on December 1, 2021. Refer to the
"Acquisitions" section for more detail.

On June 8, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire EnerBank, a
consumer lending institution specializing in home improvement lending
headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The transaction closed on October 1,
2021, and resulted in the addition of approximately $3.1 billion in loans to
consumers. Refer to the "Acquisitions" section for more detail.

SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW

Second Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $558 million,
or $0.59 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $748
million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2021. The
primary drivers of the decrease in net income from the prior year period were
a provision for credit losses compared to a benefit from credit losses in the
prior period partially offset by higher net interest income.

For the second quarter of 2022, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $1.1 billion, up $144 million compared to the second quarter of 2021.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.06 percent for the
second quarter of 2022 and 2.81 percent in the second quarter of 2021. The
increase in net interest income and net interest margin was primarily driven
by higher interest rates combined with increases in average loan balances and
average debt securities balances. Even though interest rates increased in the
second quarter of 2022, funding costs remained low. In the second quarter of
2022, net interest margin continued to be negatively impacted by elevated
liquidity. Refer to Table 18 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and
Yield/Rate Analysis" for further details.

The provision for credit losses totaled $60 million in the second quarter of
2022, as compared to a benefit of $337 million during the second quarter of
2021. The current quarter provision reflects continued strong asset quality
offset by strong loan growth and general economic uncertainty. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $38 million, or an annualized 0.17 percent of average
loans, in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $47 million, or an
annualized 0.23 percent for the second quarter of 2021. The decrease was
primarily driven by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. Refer to
the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

The allowance was 1.62 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at June
30, 2022 compared to 1.79 percent at December 31, 2021. The decrease was a
result of the factors discussed above. The allowance was 410 percent of total
non-performing loans at June 30, 2022 compared to 349 percent at December 31,
2021. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $640 million for the second quarter of 2022, a $21
million increase from the second quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily
driven by a significant increase in capital markets income, and, to a lesser
degree, an increase in card and ATM fees and other miscellaneous income. These
increases were partially offset by decreases in market value adjustments on
employee benefit assets, bank-owned life insurance, and mortgage income. See
Table 22 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $948 million in the second quarter of 2022, a
$50 million increase from the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven
by an increase in salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software
expense, and professional, legal and regulatory expenses. The increases were
partially offset by a benefit from branch consolidation, property and
equipment and a decline in marketing expense. See Table 23 "Non-Interest
Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $157 million
compared to $231 million for the same period in 2021. See "Income Taxes"
toward the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this
report for more detail.

Capital

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies, which include
quantitative requirements including the CET1 ratio. The CET1 ratio at June 30,
2022 was estimated at 9.25 percent. For additional information on Regions'
regulatory capital requirements see the "Regulatory Requirements" section.

In the second quarter of 2021, as a part of the Company's voluntary
participation in 2021 CCAR, the FRB communicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test and the Company's SCB
for the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 will be
floored at 2.5 percent. On June 27, 2022, Regions announced the Company
received the results of the 2022 stress test from the FRB, reflecting that the
Company exceeded all minimum capital levels and inclusive of a preliminary SCB
floored at 2.5 percent. On August 4, 2022, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB
requirement, and as a result for the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third
quarter of 2023 the SCB requirement will continue to be floored at 2.5
percent.

The Board authorized, on April 20, 2022, the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion
of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of
2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024.

On July 20, 2022, the Board approved an 18 percent increase to the quarterly
common stock dividend to $0.20 per share of common stock which will be payable
on October 3, 2022, to stockholders of record as of September 2, 2022.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $8.9 billion from year-end
2021 to June 30, 2022, due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit with the
FRB partially offset by an increase in cash due from other banks. In the first
six months of 2022, the Company used cash balances for securities purchases,
as a part of its hedging and active cash management strategies, and to fund
loan growth. Also contributing to the decline in cash balances is a decline in
deposits in the first six months of 2022. See the "Debt Securities", "Loans",
"Liquidity", and "Deposits" sections for more information.

DEBT SECURITIES

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including
both available for sale and held to maturity:

Corporate and other debt securities| 1,184 | | | 1,381 | | | |  
| $| 29,888 | | | $| 29,380 | | | |  
  
Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Debt securities increased $508 million from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2022
driven by increases in U.S Treasury, federal agency securities, and commercial
agency securities partially offset by declines in commercial non-agency,
corporate and other debt securities and residential agency. In the first six
months of 2022, Regions made purchases of debt securities available for sale,
excluding normal reinvestment of maturities and paydowns, totaling
approximately $2.8 billion consisting

56

Table of Contents

  

primarily of U.S. Treasury, federal agency, residential agency, and commercial
agency securities. Approximately $2.5 billion of the purchases relate to the
Company's hedging strategy with the remaining purchases related to
reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales. Partially offsetting the purchases
were declines in market valuations driven by an increase in market interest
rates.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $612 million at June 30, 2022, consisting of $292
million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $286 million of commercial
loans, $31 million of consumer and other performing loans, and $3 million of
non-performing loans. At December 31, 2021, loans held for sale totaled $1.0
billion, consisting of $680 million of residential real estate mortgage loans,
$257 million of commercial loans, $53 million of consumer and other performing
loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real
estate mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage
originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to
third parties. Commercial loans held for sale include commercial mortgage
loans originated for sale to third parties and commercial loans originally
recorded as held for investment when management has the intent to sell. Levels
of commercial loans held for sale fluctuate based on timing of sale to third
parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 65 percent of
Regions' interest-earning assets as of June 30, 2022. The following table
presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and
class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2021 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to
Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding Regions'
portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $4.7 billion since year-end 2021. The increase
in commercial and industrial loan balances was driven by new loan production
and a continued increase in line utilization. In the first six months of 2022,
commercial and industrial loan growth was broad-based and included increases
primarily in the educational services, financial services, manufacturing, real
estate, retail trade and wholesale goods industries. The June 30, 2022
commercial and industrial loan balance also included $254 million of PPP
loans, a decrease of $494 million compared to December 31, 2021, reflecting
continued PPP loan forgiveness.

The commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business
operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made
to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

________

(1)"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $585 million in comparison to 2021 year-
end balances. The increase was primarily driven by growth in term lending
commitments and fundings on previously committed construction facilities.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $380 million in comparison to 2021 year-end balances.
The increase is primarily due to a decline in prepayment rate and an increase
in ARM production retained on the balance sheet, partially offset by the sale
of approximately $285 million of Ginnie Mae loans in the first quarter of
2022, which had been previously repurchased from their pools. Approximately
$2.3 billion in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet
through the first six months of 2022.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $194 million in comparison to 2021 year-end
balances, continuing the pace of decline experienced in the past several years
as payoffs and paydowns outpaced production. Substantially all of this
portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to

59

Table of Contents

  

May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon
payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal
payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of
credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of June
30, 2022. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period. Home equity lines that are in repayment are reflected as
revolving loans converted to amortizing.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of
this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans.

Other Consumer--Exit Portfolios

Other consumer--exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third
parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other
point of sale lending. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these
businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balance has decreased
$296 million from year-end 2021.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans,
overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $530
million from year-end 2021 primarily driven by an increase in consumer home
improvement lending from the fourth quarter 2021 acquisition of EnerBank.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" .

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments
includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding
unfunded loan commitments.

The allowance totaled $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2022 compared to $1.6
billion at December 31, 2021, which represents management's best estimate of
expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios.
Key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 6 below.
While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the
category most relevant.

_______

(1)Includes pandemic-related qualitative adjustments.

(2)This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-
off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans. This line
item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $254 million and $2.9 billion as of
June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government and have an immaterial associated allowance.

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions'
internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The second quarter of
2022 exhibited solid asset quality performance. Total net charge-offs declined
4 basis points to 0.17 percent of annualized loans and commercial and investor
real estate criticized balances decreased approximately $229 million.
Partially offsetting these improvements were modest increases to classified
balances of $169 million and to non-performing loans, excluding held for sale,
and non-performing assets of $34 million and $32 million, respectively,
compared to the first quarter of 2022.

Regions' June 2022 baseline forecast remained relatively stable compared to
the March 2022 forecast driven by continued increases in HPI and stability in
unemployment offset by a slight decline in real GDP growth. The June 2022
baseline forecast continues to anticipate real GDP growth in 2022 supported
primarily by consumer spending and business investments in equipment,
machinery and intellectual property, with potential for further support from
government spending in 2023 and beyond. While the baseline forecast continues
to anticipate a double-digit increase in the HPI for full-year 2022, quarter
over quarter growth is expected to decelerate into 2023. As measured by CPI,
inflation is expected to remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target for the
remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Furthermore, ongoing disruptions in supply
chains and shipping networks, further increases in elevated inflation, and
geopolitical tensions provide significant uncertainty over the near-term
forecast.

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be
broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. In deriving its June
2022 forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external
forecasts and external data available.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of June 30, 2022. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment rates in the second quarter and the forecasted periods
remained normalized.

In the second quarter of 2022, asset quality continued to improve; however,
strong loan growth partially offset by some normalization in select sectors of
the business portfolio resulted in a modest increase to the modeled results in
the allowance for credit losses.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. Specific adjustments to modeled results were relatively
flat as declines in pandemic risk were offset by increased risks due to
inflation and rising interest rates. The qualitative framework has a general
imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast
errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. The June 30, 2022 general
imprecision allowance remained relatively flat compared to the first quarter
of 2022 and reflects continued uncertainty in the economic environment,
heightened financial volatility and supply chain issues.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$1.5 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of June 30, 2022.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 8 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." Net charge-offs decreased $46 million year-over-year,
primarily driven by a decline in net charge-offs in the commercial and
industrial portfolio and commercial investor real estate mortgage portfolio
partially offset by $17 million in net charge-offs from the addition of the
EnerBank portfolio during the first six months of 2022. As noted, economic
trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices,
collateral valuations and inflationary pressure will impact the future levels
of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics
during the remainder of 2022 and beyond. See the "Quarterly Overview" section
for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2022.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity,
consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under
the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the
result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were
offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and
investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in
interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below
market. Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed
information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"
to the consolidated financial statements.

As provided initially in the CARES Act and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, certain loan modifications related to the
COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief were not considered TDRs and are excluded from the December 31, 2021
disclosures below. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related
allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

| | | | | | |  
  
The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to Ginnie Mae where Regions has the right
but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due
guaranteed loans excluded were $28 million at June 30, 2022 and $49 million at
December 31, 2021.

Non-performing loans at June 30, 2022 decreased compared to year-end levels,
primarily driven by improvements in energy, restaurant, accommodation and
lodging, manufacturing, and utilities.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service
and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers.
Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality
banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center.

The following table summarizes deposits by category:

Table 14--Deposits

Total deposits| $| 138,263 | | | $| 139,072 | | |  
| | | | |  
| | | | |  
| | | | |  
  
Total deposits at June 30, 2022 decreased approximately $809 million compared
to year-end 2021 levels driven by declines in interest-bearing checking, money
market and time deposits. The declines in interest-bearing checking and money
market are driven by a return to seasonal deposit patterns observed prior to
the pandemic and some commercial and wealth management customers beginning to
reduce their excess balances. The decline in time deposits was driven by a
decline in time deposits acquired through EnerBank as these deposits are not
being replaced when they mature. Partially offsetting these declines was an
increase in consumer savings due to seasonality while non-interest bearing
demand deposits remained relatively stable.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $16.5 billion at June 30, 2022 as compared to $18.3
billion at December 31, 2021. During the first six months of 2022, net income
increased shareholders' equity by $1.1 billion, cash dividends on common stock
reduced shareholders' equity by $318 million, and cash dividends on preferred
stock reduced shareholders' equity by $49 million. Changes in AOCI decreased
shareholders' equity by $2.4 billion, primarily due to the net change in
unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative
instruments as a result of significant changes in market interest rates during
the six months ended June 30, 2022. Common stock repurchased during the first
six months of 2022 decreased shareholders' equity $230 million. These shares
were immediately retired and therefore are not included in treasury stock.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized
approach bank. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under the FRB's rules
for tailoring enhanced prudential standards.

Federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on
regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital
was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of
subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year
period beginning in 2022. At June 30, 2022, the net impact of the add-back on
CET1 was approximately $306 million, or approximately 25 basis points. The
add-back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million or 10 basis points
in both 2023 and 2024.

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory requirements:

(1)The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,
and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

As a result of Regions' voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR, effective
October 1, 2021, Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2021
through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent. On June 27,
2022, Regions announced the Company received the results of the 2022 stress
test from the FRB, reflecting that the Company exceeded all minimum capital
levels and inclusive of a preliminary SCB floored at 2.5 percent. On August 4,
2022, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement, and as a result for the
fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 the SCB requirement
will continue to be floored at 2.5 percent.

See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations of a
range for CET1 during 2022.

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions,
recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and
recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the
"Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section in the 2021
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory Requirements" section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additional discussion is also included in Note 12 "Regulatory Capital
Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the
2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2021 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest
income", "adjusted total revenue", "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent
basis", and "adjusted operating leverage ratio". Regions believes that
excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period
comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the
operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-
GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance
of Regions' business because management does not consider the activities
related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions
believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit
investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that
applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP
financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at
adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) is
presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income
on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented
excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP).
Net interest income (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are
added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP). Net interest
income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a
taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). The adjusted operating leverage ratio
(non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is calculated as the year over
year percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis
less the year over year percentage change in adjusted total non-interest
expense. Management uses this ratio to monitor performance and believes it
provides meaningful information to investors.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes certain adjustments does
not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

(6)The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the
statutory federal income tax rate of 21% adjusted for applicable state income
taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.

Net interest income is Regions' principal source of income and is one of the
most important elements of Regions' ability to meet its overall performance
goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by
market interest rates, and in the first six months of 2022, the FOMC increased
the Fed funds rate by 150 basis points, with additional rate increases
expected in the remaining half of 2022.

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased in the second quarter
and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The
increases in net interest income were driven primarily by rising interest
rates, strong average loan growth and a larger securities portfolio. While
interest rates increased in the first half of 2022, funding costs remained
relatively stable. These increases were partially offset by a decline in PPP
forgiveness income as compared to the same periods in 2021.

Net interest margin also increased in the second quarter and first six months
of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, benefiting from the rising
interest rate environment and controlled deposit costs. Elevated liquidity
continues to impact

net interest margin, as average cash balances remained higher in the second
quarter and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021.

See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for the Company's expectations for
interest income as a component of total revenue. See also the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" section below for additional information.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points. Importantly, the falling
rate shock scenarios incorporate historical observations. Rates along the
yield curve are not allowed to fall below levels consistent with historical
12-month average rate minimums. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple
curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes
simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month
period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate
movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of June 30, 2022, Regions was asset
sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as
compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending June
2023.

In the second quarter of 2022, Regions experienced stability in low-cost
deposits acquired through the pandemic. Retention of these deposits remains
uncertain and some amount may be more rate sensitive in a rising rate
environment. Therefore, additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-
related "surge" deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in Table
19.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. Currently, net interest income is projected to
benefit from rising short-term interest rates (i.e. asset sensitive profile).
An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds
rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves, 1-month LIBOR, SOFR and BSBY)
will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such
rates higher or lower. Under either environment, it is expected that changes
in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset
the change in asset yields. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge"
deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity
for further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario as
well.

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors. While
this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it represents
a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises. An increase
in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-
term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on
certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective
yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of
premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The
opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest
rates fall.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 19 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with monetary policy tightening on the pace of interest rate movement and
industry liquidity levels, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity
analysis from these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical
and should not be considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the
behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is
uncertain. Since year-end 2019, the last period-end free from the effects of
the pandemic, deposit balances have increased by approximately $40 billion,
exclusive of deposits acquired in the EnerBank acquisition, and approximately
$25 billion of the increase was determined to be attributable to pandemic-
related surge deposits. Therefore, Table 19 includes two balance sheet
scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an
opportunity scenario, and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable,
legacy balances, which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second
scenario assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate,
requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the
bank. These deposits, including non-interest bearing products, are attributed
with an approximate 70 percent repricing beta in rising rate scenarios.
Importantly, the impact to net interest income under a changing rate
environment is the same whether the "surge" deposit balances are held at a
higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale
sources. Given the evolving nature of the environment, estimates have been
conservatively derived. Should the balances remain with the Company longer or
demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates, there is potential for upside
(e.g. the opportunity scenario). The disclosure in Table 19 does not prescribe
a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet.

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels
is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case
scenario in Table 19, interest-bearing deposits reprice using an approximately
30 percent cumulative beta. The deposit beta model is dynamic across both
interest rate level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100 basis
point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate 25 percent to
30 percent interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the
"surge" deposit interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario,
assuming legacy betas and a 70 percent beta, respectively. Deposit pricing
outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in that scenario would
increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $39 million,
respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from
non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of
the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12
months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 19.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in
various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors).
The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. All
forward-starting swaps have starting dates beyond the next 12 months.
Therefore, while not impactful to the reported exposure, hedges will
meaningfully reduce the net interest income sensitivity to changes in market
interest rates over the coming year as they enter the measurement window. More
information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 20 and its accompanying
description.

(1)Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward
looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases
and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.

(2)Active cash flow hedges reflected within the measurement horizon (See Table
21 for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates).

(3)Scenario One assumes all deposits (including "surge" deposits) perform
consistently with historical experiences.

(4)Scenario Two accounts for uncertainty in "surge" deposit balances
(approximately $25 billion) and assumes an approximate 70% beta.

(5)The -200 basis points (floored) scenario represents a rate shock where all
rates decline by 200 basis points, or are floored at their 12-month average
historical low.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
equal to the historical 12-month average minimum. The falling rate scenarios
in Table 19 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and
instantaneous shocks under this environment.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity.

Regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses
derivatives, as discussed further below, and debt securities to manage its
interest rate risk position. During the second quarter of 2022, as part of its
current hedging strategy, the Company executed $8.3 billion of notional value
cash flow hedging derivative trades (included in Table 20 below) and purchased
$1.2 billion in debt securities available for sale in addition to the trades
and purchases that were executed in the first quarter of 2022. The cash flow
hedging relationships are forward starting receive fixed/pay variable interest
rate swaps, that have start dates in the third quarter of 2023 and mature
within three to four years of their start dates. The receive fixed rates on
these cash flow hedges averaged 2.99 percent, paying overnight SOFR. The
purchased debt securities available for sale consisted primarily of federal
agency and residential agency securities, and yield approximately 3.30
percent.

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a

78

* * *

Table of Contents

  

predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are
executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its
fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate
position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial

79

Table of Contents

  

strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by
entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is
more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally
enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net
of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted
to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by
Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared
trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse
allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the
respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in this report contains
more information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.

See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-
end derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use
after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or
2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31, 2021.
Regions successfully remediated contracts referencing 1-week or 2-month USD
LIBOR prior to December 31, 2021. Additionally, Regions ceased origination of
all new LIBOR-based lending prior to December 31, 2021. Existing contracts
referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than June
30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance
of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate
obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark
rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in settings other than
1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition
Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant
business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this program, the
Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the
discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks associated with the
transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR Steering Committee.
Regions is following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates
and is operationally ready to offer new benchmarks as they are adopted by
regulatory agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

•The discontinuation of LIBOR-based commercial lending prior to December 31,
2021, consistent with regulatory guidelines. The Company is providing multiple
alternative rates based on market competition and demand, including SOFR,
BSBY, and AMERIBOR.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

Regions has exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several lines of
business. As of June 30, 2022, Regions had the following exposures that
reference LIBOR:

•Approximately $24.8 billion of total outstanding commercial and investor real
estate loans and approximately $784 million of total consumer loans;

•Securities within the investment portfolio of approximately $261 million;

•Notional amount of interest rate derivatives totaling approximately $130
billion;

80

* * *

Table of Contents

  

•Series B and C preferred stock with total carrying values of $433 million and
$490 million, respectively that reference LIBOR when their dividend rate
begins to float after 2023.

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into law with
the purpose of establishing a clear and uniform process for replacing LIBOR in
existing contracts. Among the provisions of this legislation, contracts may be
transitioned to SOFR to gain a legal safe harbor. The Company has assessed the
impact of this legislation and expects to allow certain clients to fallback to
SOFR upon the cessation of LIBOR, consistent with the guidelines in the
legislation.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers.
Regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain liquidity sources and
reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions
maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further
described below. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including
scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate
levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity
base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans,
and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in
the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by
Regions' relatively steady deposit base.

The securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of
liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of
securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements).
Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the portfolio (for example, the
agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash
through various secured borrowing arrangements. Cash reserves, liquid assets
and secured borrowing capabilities (including borrowing capacity at the FHLB,
as discussed below) aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed
conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations
related to potential litigation. See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements. Liquidity needs can also be met by
borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits
on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such
markets.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At June 30, 2022, Regions
had approximately $18.2 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB and other
depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $28.1 billion at
December 31, 2021, as cash balances have been used fund loan growth and for
securities purchases in the first six months of 2022. The average balance held
with the FRB was approximately $22.2 billion and $23.3 billion for the three
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to the "Cash and Cash
Equivalents" section for more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of June 30, 2022, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $15.1 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of June 30, 2022, Regions had no
FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $15.4 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain
eligible securities and loans as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances.
Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of
outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a
reliable and economical source of funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial
statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash
sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other
cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.2 billion at June 30, 2022.
Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk

Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO
regularly review compliance with the established limits.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber
attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in
attempts to compromise or disable information systems. Such attempts have
increased in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue for a number
of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used
by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer
transactions. The related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new
cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies
on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and
although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security
capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase
exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses totaled $60 million
in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $337
million during the second quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses
totaled $24 million for the first six months of 2022 compared to a benefit
from credit losses of $479 million for the first six months of 2021. Refer to
the "Allowance" section for further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. Capital markets income increased in both the
second quarter of 2022 and first six months of 2022 compared to the same
periods in 2021. The increase in the second quarter of 2022 was driven
primarily by real estate capital markets, commercial swap income, and M&A
advisory fees. The increase in commercial swap income benefited from positive
credit/debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movement. M&A
advisory fees were positively impacted by the acquisition of Clearsight
Advisors in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase for the first six months
of 2022 was driven by increases in real estate capital markets, loan
syndication revenue, and commercial swap income. In both periods, the
increases in capital markets income were partially offset by declines in
securities underwriting and placement fees.

Investment management and trust fee income--Investment management and trust
fee income represents income from asset management services provided to
individuals, businesses and institutions.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage
income in the

83

Table of Contents

  

second quarter of 2022 and first six months of 2022 compared to the same
periods in 2021 was due primarily to lower mortgage production as a result of
higher interest rates. The decline in production and sales was partially
offset by an improvement in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and
related hedges. Mortgage income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 also
includes approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-
securitization and sale of Ginnie Mae loans previously repurchased from their
pools in the first quarter of 2022.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance income primarily
represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of
insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned
life insurance decreased in the second quarter of 2022 and first six months of
2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to an $18 million
individual BOLI claim benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2021.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets decreased in the three and six months ended June
30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to market volatility. The
adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check
fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods of 2021 primarily due
to an increase in commercial loan and leasing related fee income generated
from Ascentium, low income housing tax credit disposition gains, and, to a
lesser degree, an increase in other consumer income. The increase in income
for the first six months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was
partially offset by a decline in SBIC income.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Full-time equivalent headcount increased to 19,673 at June
30, 2022 from 18,814 at June 30, 2021, reflecting the additional associates
from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Salaries and employee
benefits expense also increased in the second quarter of 2022 and the first
six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to
annual merit increases that occurred early in the second quarter of 2022 and,
to a lesser degree, higher production-based incentive compensation. These
increases were partially offset by a decline in 401(k) related expenses.

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses--Professional, legal, and
regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other
professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal, and regulatory
expenses increased in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period
in 2021 primarily due to [an increase in legal expenses].

Credit/checkcard expenses--Credit/checkcard expenses include credit and
checkcard fraud and expenses. Credit/checkcard expenses increased the first
six months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an
accrual increase associated with a previous debit card matter that occurred
during the first quarter of 2022, which was partially offset by a slight
decline in debit card servicing expenses.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives. During the
second quarter of 2022, the Company recognized gains on the disposition of
branch properties.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was
$157 million compared to $231 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.2 percent and 22.6 percent,
respectively. The income tax expense for six months ended June 30, 2022 was
$311 million compared to $411 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021,
resulting in effective tax rates of 21.6 percent and 22.3 percent,
respectively. See the "Second Quarter Overview" for the Company's near-term
expectations for future tax rates.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance
income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the
effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but
are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain
leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and
changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the
effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

At June 30, 2022, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $429
million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $306 million at December
31, 2021. The change in the net deferred tax position was due primarily to the
deferred tax impact of unrealized losses on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments arising during the period.

ACQUISITIONS

EnerBank

On October 1, 2021, Regions completed its acquisition of home improvement
lender EnerBank. The acquisition of EnerBank allows Regions to provide
customers with home improvement financing solutions using EnerBank's loan
programs and digital solutions to support a wide range of home improvement
needs.

As a result of the acquisition, Regions recorded approximately $3.3 billion of
assets of which $3.1 billion were loans that are included in Regions' other
consumer loan portfolio. Regions also assumed $2.8 billion of liabilities,
consisting almost entirely of time deposits that the Company expects will
attrite over time. The premiums recorded related to the acquired assets and
assumed liabilities were immaterial.

Fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of June 30, 2022. Fair
value estimates, including loans, intangible assets and goodwill, are subject
to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional
information becomes available.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $198 million as a result of the acquisition.
Regions recorded an immaterial ALLL related to these loans, which was included
in the total acquired asset value as part of the acquisition.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions recognized initial goodwill of
$361 million and other intangible assets of $176 million. The other intangible
assets were primarily comprised of customer relationship intangibles and will
be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized asset.

Sabal

On December 1, 2021, Regions completed its acquisition of Sabal, a financial
services firm that leverages technology to facilitate off-balance-sheet
lending in the small balance commercial real estate market.

As a result of the acquisition, Regions recorded approximately $360 million of
assets, which included loans held for sale totaling $82 million, as well as a
commercial mortgage servicing asset and securities that were immaterial.
Regions also assumed $114 million of liabilities, consisting primarily of
borrowings that were paid off following closing.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions recognized initial goodwill of
$146 million and other intangible assets that were immaterial.

Fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of June 30, 2022. Fair
value estimates, including acquired assets and goodwill, are subject to change
for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information
becomes available.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risks, including the risk factors
discussed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the "2021 Form 10-K"), which risk
factors have not materially changed except as set forth below. The risk
factors below supersede the similarly captioned risk factors set forth in the
2021 Form 10-K and supplement the other risk factors in the 2021 Form 10-K.
They reflect modifications to the nature of the risks that have developed
since the date on which the 2021 Form 10-K was filed.

Our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

We provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as
well as other financial services including asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and
other specialty financing. All of our businesses are materially affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the South,
Midwest and Texas, the principal markets in which we conduct business. Global
economic conditions also affect our operating results because global economic
conditions directly influence the U.S. economic conditions. Sources of global
economic and market instability include, but are not limited to, the potential
for an economic slowdown in United Kingdom, Europe and the United States; the
impact of trade negotiations; economic conditions in China, including the
global economic impacts of the Chinese economy and China's regulation of
commerce; and escalating military tensions in Europe as a result of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. Various market conditions also affect our operating
results. Certain changes in interest rates, inflation, or the financial
markets could affect demand for our products. A worsening of business and
economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in
which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business,
including the following:

•A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other
products and services offered by us;

•A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by
consumer or commercial real estate;

•An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;

•A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in
interest rates; and

•An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become
delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their
loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses, and
valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

In the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can
be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would
intervene. Further, the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic (including variant
strains and resurgences of the COVID-19 virus) and its effects on the U.S. and
global economy remains uncertain, as does the success of any measures taken or
that may be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which ultimately may
not be sufficient to address the specific effects of the pandemic or avert
severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. If economic conditions
worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation,
which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially
contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may enhance or
contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher
inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce
demand for the our products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the
Company's borrowers or result in lower values for our investment securities
and other interest-earning assets. In response to sustained inflationary
pressures, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points on
March 16, 2022, by 50 basis points on May 4, 2022, by 75 basis points on June
15, 2022, and by an additional 75 basis points on July 27, 2022. The Federal
Reserve has also signaled its intention to continue to raise interest rates
over the course of 2022 and has announced that it will begin to taper its
purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and treasury securities. To the
extent these policies do not mitigate the volatility and uncertainty related
to inflation and the effects of inflation, or to the extent conditions
otherwise worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.

Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which
is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning
assets (primarily loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held
at the FRB) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-
bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net
interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-
earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the
spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities.
These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by
external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and
deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC and interest rates markets.

88

Table of Contents

  

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based
on market-based liquidity and short-term interest rates, the level of which is
influenced heavily by the FOMC's monetary policy. However, the yields
generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both short-term
and longer-term interest rates. Longer-term rates are affected by multiple
factors including the actions of the FOMC such as quantitative easing or
tightening, as well as the market's expectations for future inflation, growth
and other economic considerations. The level of net interest income is,
therefore, influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the
shape of the yield curve. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains
or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our
interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates
on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline. Our net
interest income would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our
interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on
our interest-bearing liabilities.

The low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal
Reserve increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points
on March 16, 2022, by 50 basis points on May 4, 2022, by 75 basis points on
June 15, 2022, and by an additional 75 basis points on July 27, 2022. The
Federal Reserve has signaled that there will be additional federal funds
interest rate increases during the remainder of 2022. While an increasing rate
environment would have a positive impact on net interest income, increasing
rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers
and may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually
obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our
results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected
as a result. Conversely, should interest rates move lower, we would expect
modest declines in net interest income over the next twelve months given the
protection that remains in place from the Company's interest rate hedging
program.

For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies
for these risks, see the "First Quarter Overview", "Net Interest Income and
Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Securities" sections of Item 2.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the "Executive
Overview", "Net Interest Income, Margin and Interest Rate Risk," "Net Interest
Income and Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Securities" sections
of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an
adverse impact on our operations.

We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and
examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the
businesses in which we may permissibly engage. The laws and regulations
governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our
depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund,
not our shareholders or other creditors. These laws and regulations govern a
variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control,
maintenance of adequate capital, and general business operations and financial
condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and
investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on
dividends and repurchases of our capital securities, establishment of branch
offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). Further,
we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many
activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict
us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can be no assurance that any
regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained.

Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing
continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such
changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed
at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions
Bank and our subsidiaries, including any changes resulting from the recent
change in U.S. presidential administration and change in control of the U.S.
Senate.

In addition, as climate change issues become more prevalent, the U.S. and
foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues. The increasing
governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental
regulations, including disclosure required by the SEC, that could result in
additional compliance costs.

Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and
governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect
us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to
appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could
result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to
our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Our regulatory capital position is
discussed in greater detail in the "Regulatory Requirements" section in Item
1. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations of
this Form 10-Q and Note 12 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions"
to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2021.

As of June 30, 2022, Regions repurchased approximately 725 thousand shares of

included in treasury stock.
