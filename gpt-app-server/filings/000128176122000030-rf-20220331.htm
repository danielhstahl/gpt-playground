Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that the actual
effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those
forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are
uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the
scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the impact of
additional variants and resurgences), the effectiveness, availability and
acceptance of any vaccines or therapies, and the direct and indirect impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, third parties and us. Forward-looking
statements are not based on historical information, but rather are related to
future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.
Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations as
well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available
to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based
on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also
relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the
views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we
caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These
risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those
described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of any pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the
global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair
the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance
for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or
additional expenses.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law,
which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return
capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as
changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by
applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of
the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress,
and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require
us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our
revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our
businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum
capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and
must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by
our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to
shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our businesses.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses, including our recently completed acquisitions of EnerBank, Sabal,
and Clearsight, and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the
expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not
be realized within the expected timeframes, or might be less than projected;
difficulties in integrating the businesses; and the inability of Regions to
effectively cross-sell products following these acquisitions.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses,
such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and
other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach
of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act
or failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our businesses on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and frequency of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of

6

* * *

Table of Contents

  

commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans
outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or
damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our
reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions
Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of anti-takeover and exclusive forum laws and provision in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

  

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

See also the reports filed with the SEC, including the discussion under the
"Risk Factors" section of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 and as filed with the SEC and available on its website

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 479 at December 31, 2021, to 1,325 at March 31,
2022. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2021 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss represented credit impairment as of those dates.
The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of
their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale for the three months ended March 31, 2022 are presented
below. Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt
securities available for sale were immaterial for the three months ended March
31, 2021. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating impairment,
management did not identify any positions where impairment was believed to
exist in either of the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate and consumer.
Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to Note 5
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 for information regarding Regions' portfolio segments
and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal
banking regulators' definitions and are utilized to develop the associated
allowance. Refer to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for information regarding
commercial risk ratings.

Regions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique
credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices
and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio.
FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal
underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans.
Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for
various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an
updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop
the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less
probability of default and vice versa.

The following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, by vintage year
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Classes in the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes
in the consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer
to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2021 for more information regarding Regions'
credit quality indicators.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 5
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding the Company's
TDRs, including their impact on the allowance and designation of TDRs in
periods subsequent to the modification.

As provided initially in the CARES Act and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, certain loan modifications related to the
COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief were not considered TDRs and are excluded from the December 31, 2021
disclosures below.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

________

(1)Purchases of residential MSRs can be structured with cash hold back
provisions, therefore the timing of payment may be made in future periods.

(2)Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology
is a discounted net cash flow approach.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 41,639 | | | $| 34,212 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 9.6 | %| | 10.2 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (48)| | | $| (28)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (78)| | | $| (51)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 445| | 564 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (10)| | | $| (10)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (21)| | | $| (21)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.5 | %| | 3.8 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 299| | 289  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.4 | | | 27.5 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income
resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans:

Servicing related fees and other ancillary income| $| 27 | | | $| 24 | | | | |  
  
Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 11 for additional information.

the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, a total of $24 million in cash
dividends on total preferred stock was declared in the first three months of
2022 compared to the total of $28 million in cash dividends on total preferred
stock for the same period in 2021.

In the event Series B, Series C, Series D or Series E preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $67 million, $10 million, $4 million, or
$10 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to common shareholders'
equity. The remaining amounts listed represent issuance costs that were
recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will
be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

As a result of Regions' voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR, effective
October 1, 2021, Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2021
through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's 2021 capital plan, the Board authorized the
repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
During the three months ended March 31, 2022, Regions repurchased
approximately 9.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $215
million and concluded the plan in the first quarter of 2022. All of these
shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore, were not
included in treasury stock.

On April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion
of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of
2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of May 4, 2022, Regions had
repurchased approximately 725 thousand shares of common stock at a total cost
of $15 million under this plan. All of these shares were immediately retired
upon repurchase and therefore will not be included in treasury stock.

The Board declared a $0.17 per share cash dividend on common stock for the
first quarter 2022 as compared to $0.155 per common share for the first
quarter 2021.

and awards and performance stock units for both the three months ended March
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in the above computations
of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an
antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.

NOTE 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Regions' defined benefit pension plans cover certain employees as the pension
plans are closed to new entrants. The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a
non-qualified pension plan that provides certain senior executive officers
defined benefits in relation to their compensation.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (credit) is recorded
in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

Regions' funding policy for the qualified plans is to contribute annually at
least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made no
contributions during the first three months of 2022.

Regions also provides other postretirement benefits, such as defined benefit
health care plans and life insurance plans, that cover certain retired
employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on
the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2022 or 2021.

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Includes accrued interest of $13 million at March 31, 2022 and $12 million
at December 31, 2021.

(3)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements, and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions also enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate prepayable and non-prepayable debt securities available for sale. These
agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-
rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate
loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest
rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR or SOFR interest rate swaps and
interest rate floors. As of March 31, 2022, Regions is hedging its exposure to
the variability in future cash flows through 2029.

hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is $280 million
in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow
hedges.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to-market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Regions had $497 million and $419
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
Regions had $872 million and $987 million, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans

are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest
rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to
commercial mortgage loans are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss)
recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2022 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2022 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of March 31, 2022 was approximately $409 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at March 31, 2022 and
2021 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were $139 million and $81 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $148 million and $84
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis:

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

Commercial mortgage loans held for sale

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
commercial mortgage loans held for sale are credit spreads for bonds in
commercial mortgage-backed securitization. Commercial mortgage loans held for
sale are valued based on traded market prices for comparable commercial
mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted
for movements of interest rates and credit spreads. Increases or decreases in
credit spreads would result in an inverse impact to fair value.

The following tables present detailed information regarding material assets
and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The tables include the
valuation techniques and the significant unobservable inputs utilized. The
range of each significant unobservable input as well as the weighted-average
within the range utilized at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, are

FAIR VALUE OPTION

As discussed above, the Company elected the option to measure certain
commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. At March 31, 2022, the
balance of these loans was immaterial. At December 31, 2021, commercial
mortgage loans held for sale at fair value had both an aggregate fair value
and unpaid principal balance of $90 million.

The Company has elected the option to measure certain commercial and
industrial loans held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively
traded in the secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value
estimates for substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation
service that is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans
are traded in the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject
to variability and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these
loans held for sale was immaterial at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
first mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows
for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the
derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of
complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Fair values of
residential first mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market
prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at
market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include
servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for
sale.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential first mortgage
loans held for sale measured at fair value:

fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale, which were recorded in
mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income during the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. These changes in fair value are mostly
offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts
was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include loans held for
sale for which the fair value option has not been elected, foreclosed property
and other real estate and equity investments without a readily determinable
fair value; all of which may be considered either Level 2 or Level 3 valuation
measurements. Non-recurring fair value adjustments related to loans held for
sale, foreclosed property and other real estate are typically a result of the
application of lower of cost or fair

value accounting during the period. Non-recurring fair value adjustments
related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values are the
result of impairments or price changes from observable transactions. The
balances of each of these assets, as well as the related fair value
adjustments during the periods, were immaterial at both March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021.

(1)Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

(2)The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at March 31,
2022 was $1.6 billion or 1.9 percent.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior period was updated to reflect
these enhancements.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 23 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| March 31, 2022| | December 31, 2021

Liabilities associated with standby letters of credit| 30 | | | 28 |  
Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 31 | | | 29 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 76 | | | 95 |  
  
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
March 31, 2022, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. With respect to the CFPB
investigation described below, Regions believes that a loss is reasonably
possible; however, the amount of such possible loss, if any, cannot currently
be estimated. As available information changes, the matters for which Regions
is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted
accordingly.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not
complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. As previously disclosed,
Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the CFPB into certain of
Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional inquiries from such
governmental regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-
regulatory bodies will arise from time to time. In connection with those
inquiries, Regions receives document requests, subpoenas and other requests
for information. The inquiries could develop into administrative, civil or
criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that could result in consequences
that have a material effect on Regions' consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could
include adverse judgments, findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders,
injunctions, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and could
result in additional expenses and collateral costs, including reputational
damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions sells commercial loans to Fannie Mae through the DUS lending program
and through other platforms. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal
balance for the majority of the commercial servicing portfolio. At both March
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled
approximately $4.7 billion. Regions has additional loans sold to Fannie Mae
outside of the DUS program that are also subject to a loss share guarantee and
at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 these serviced loans totaled
approximately $493 million and $400 million, respectively. Regions' maximum
quantifiable contingent liability related to all loans subject to a loss share
guarantee was approximately $1.7 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans
it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss,
were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was
determined to be without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the
maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual
loss the Company would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the
associated loss share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's
consolidated balance sheets was approximately $7 million at both March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021, for additional information.

This Update represents the final amended guidance to the 'last-of-layer' hedge
model for fair value hedge relationships. The last-of-layer method allowed for
essentially a single hedge for a given portfolio of only prepayable assets.

  

The 'portfolio layer' method will make the hedging asset side of the balance
sheet easier as it allows for more flexibility in the use of derivatives and
structures that best align with management's objectives for hedging purposes.
Multiple hedged layers are permitted in fair value hedge relationships for a
closed portfolio of financial assets. Both prepayable and non-prepayable
financial instruments may be used and included.

  

The Update permits reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity
to available-for-sale upon adoption with restrictions. Portfolio layer method
hedging must be applied to those debt securities. Also, the decision to
reclassify must be within 30 days after the date of adoption, and securities
would need to be included in a closed portfolio that is designed in a
portfolio layer method hedge within that 30-day period.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K. See
Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements"
to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of
this discussion will be on the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2021 for the consolidated statements of
income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion
will be the balances as of March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 7 through 9 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. In addition, Regions operates
several offices delivering specialty capabilities in New York, Washington
D.C., Chicago and other locations nationwide. Regions provides financial
solutions for a wide range of clients including retail and mortgage banking
services, commercial banking services and wealth and investment services.
Further, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including
merger and acquisition advisory services, capital market solutions, home
improvement lending and others.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At March 31, 2022, Regions operated 1,294 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment
Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

On December 17, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Clearsight
Advisors, Inc., a leading-edge mergers and acquisitions firm headquartered in
McLean, Virginia. The transaction closed on December 31, 2021.

On October 4, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital
Partners, LLC, a diversified financial services firm that facilitates lending
in the small-balance commercial real estate market headquartered in Irvine,
California. The transaction closed on December 1, 2021. Refer to the
"Acquisitions" section for more detail.

On June 8, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire EnerBank, a
consumer lending institution specializing in home improvement lending
headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The transaction closed on October 1,
2021, and resulted in the addition of approximately $3.1 billion in loans to
consumers. Refer to the "Acquisitions" section for more detail.

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

First Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $524 million,
or $0.55 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $614
million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2021. The primary
drivers of the decrease in net income from the prior year period were a
smaller benefit from credit losses and lower non-interest income, partially
offset by higher net interest income.

For the first quarter of 2022, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $1.0 billion, up $48 million compared to the first quarter of 2021.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 2.85 percent for the
first quarter of 2022 and 3.02 percent in the first quarter of 2021. The
increase in net interest income was primarily driven by increases in average
loan balances and average debt securities balances, as well as lower funding
costs. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by continued elevated
liquidity as evidenced by higher average cash balances held at the Federal
Reserve. Refer to Table 18 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate
Analysis" for further details.

The benefit for credit losses totaled $36 million in the first quarter of
2022, as compared to a benefit of $142 million during the first quarter of
2021. The current quarter benefit was primarily due to positive asset quality
and waning pandemic concerns partially offset by loan growth and heightened
economic volatility. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for
further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $46 million, or an annualized 0.21 percent of average
loans, in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $83 million, or an annualized
0.40 percent for the first quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily driven
by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. Refer to the "Allowance
for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

The allowance was 1.67 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at March
31, 2022 compared to 1.79 percent at December 31, 2021. The decrease was a
result of the factors discussed above. The allowance was 446 percent of total
non-performing loans at March 31, 2022 compared to 349 percent at December 31,
2021. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $584 million for the first quarter of 2022, a $57
million decrease from the first quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily
driven by declines in mortgage income, capital markets income, and market
value adjustments on employee benefit assets. These decreases were partially
offset by increases in service charges, card and ATM fees, and other non-
interest income. See Table 22 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $933 million in the first quarter of 2022, a $5
million increase from the first quarter of 2021. See Table 23 "Non-Interest
Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $154 million
compared to $180 million for the same period in 2021. See "Income Taxes"
toward the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this
report for more detail.

Capital

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies, which include
quantitative requirements including the CET1 ratio. The CET1 ratio at March
31, 2022 was estimated at 9.39 percent. For additional information on Regions'
regulatory capital requirements see the "Regulatory Requirements" section.

In the second quarter of 2021, Regions received the results of the Company's
voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR. The FRB communicated that the Company
exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test and the
Company's stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of 2021 through the
third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.

On April 20, 2022, the Company declared a cash dividend for the second quarter
of 2022 of $0.17 per share of common stock. Also on April 20, 2022, the Board
authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock,
permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth
quarter of 2024. As of May 4, 2022, Regions had repurchased approximately 725
thousand shares of common stock at a total cost of $15 million under this
plan. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and
therefore will not be included in treasury stock.

(1)The total adjusted revenue expectation is consistent with the expectation
that was disclosed in Exhibit 99.3 of the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April
22, 2022. This expectation utilizes the forward interest rate curve at March
31, 2022, and does not contemplate purchases of debt securities available for
sale subsequent to March 31, 2022. See the "Market Risk--Interest Rate Risk"
section for further discussion of those purchases.

(2)Does not include the impact of potential tax legislation.

Regions believes that expressing certain expectations as non-GAAP measures
will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and
predicting future performance on the same basis as that applied by management.
The reconciliation with respect to these forward-looking non-GAAP measures is
expected to be consistent with the actual non-GAAP reconciliations within
Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $1.5 billion from year-end
2021 to March 31, 2022, due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit with
the FRB. While deposit balances increased in the first quarter of 2022 due to
seasonality, Regions has an active cash management strategy in which the
Company has deployed some excess liquidity from deposit growth as
opportunities exist given market interest rates, primarily through securities
purchases. See the "Debt Securities", "Liquidity", and "Deposits" sections for
more information.

DEBT SECURITIES

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including
both available for sale and held to maturity:

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Table of Contents

  

Debt securities increased $868 million from December 31, 2021 to March 31,
2022 driven by increases in federal agency securities and residential agency
securities. In the first quarter of 2022, Regions made purchases of debt
securities available for sale, excluding normal reinvestment of maturities,
totaling approximately $2.1 billion consisting primarily of federal agency and
residential agency securities. Approximately $1.5 billion of the purchases
related to a hedging strategy with the remaining purchases related to active
cash management strategies. Partially offsetting the first quarter purchases
were declines in market valuations driven by an increase in market interest
rates.

See the "Market Risk--Interest Rate Risk" section for more information
regarding purchases of debt securities available for sale subsequent to March
31, 2022.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $694 million at March 31, 2022, consisting of $479
million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $168 million of commercial
loans, $40 million of consumer and other performing loans, and $7 million of
non-performing loans. At December 31, 2021, loans held for sale totaled $1.0
billion, consisting of $680 million of residential real estate mortgage loans,
$257 million of commercial loans, $53 million of consumer and other performing
loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real
estate mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage
originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to
third parties. Commercial loans held for sale include commercial mortgage
loans originated for sale to third parties and commercial loans originally
recorded as held for investment when management has the intent to sell. Levels
of commercial loans held for sale fluctuate based on timing of sale to third
parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 61 percent of
Regions' interest-earning assets as of March 31, 2022. The following table
presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and
class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2021 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to
Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding Regions'
portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $1.9 billion since year-end 2021. The increase
in commercial and industrial loan balances was driven by new loan production
and a continued increase in line utilization. In the first quarter of 2022,
commercial and industrial loan growth was broad-based and included increases
in the information, manufacturing, real estate and wholesale goods industries.
The March 31, 2022 commercial and industrial loan balance also included $437
million of PPP loans, a decrease of $311 million compared to December 31,
2021, reflecting continued PPP loan forgiveness.

The commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business
operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made
to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

(1)"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $137 million in comparison to 2021 year-
end balances.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans decreased $139 million in comparison to 2021 year-end balances.
The decrease in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by the
first quarter of 2022 re-securitization and sale of approximately $285 million
of Ginnie Mae loans that had been previously re-purchased from their pools.
Approximately $1.0 billion in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the first three months of 2022.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $142 million in comparison to 2021 year-end
balances, continuing the pace of decline experienced in the past several years
as payoffs and paydowns outpaced production. Substantially all of this
portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to

51

* * *

Table of Contents

  

May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon
payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal
payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of
credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March
31, 2022. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of
this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $51 million from
year-end 2021.

Other Consumer--Exit Portfolios

Other consumer--exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third
parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other
point of sale lending. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these
businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balance has decreased
$162 million from year-end 2021.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans,
overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $130
million from year-end 2021 primarily driven by an increase in consumer home
improvement lending from the fourth quarter 2021 acquisition of EnerBank.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments
includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding
unfunded loan commitments.

The allowance totaled $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 compared to $1.6
billion at December 31, 2021, which represents management's best estimate of
expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios.
Key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 6 below.
While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the
category most relevant.

_______

(1)This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-
off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans. This line
item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $437 million and $4.3 billion as of
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government and have an immaterial associated allowance.

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions'
internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The first quarter of
2022 exhibited continued strong asset quality performance. While total net
charge-offs remained relatively flat, commercial and investor real estate
criticized balances decreased approximately $366 million and classified
balances decreased $238 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-
performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets decreased
approximately $116 million and $123 million, respectively, compared to the
fourth quarter of 2021.

Regions' March 2022 baseline forecast was generally improved compared to the
December 2021 forecast with continued increases in key model variables
including HPI and unemployment with stable GDP growth after the first quarter
of 2022. The March 2022 baseline forecast anticipates above-trend real GDP
growth in 2022, supported primarily by consumer spending and business
investments in equipment, machinery and intellectual property, with potential
for further support from government spending in 2023 and beyond. The Company
expects that by mid-2023 the economy will be back on a GDP growth path of
around 2.5 percent that prevailed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the
baseline forecast anticipates a double-digit increase in the HPI for full-year
2022, quarter over quarter growth is expected to decelerate sharply into 2023.
As measured by CPI, inflation is expected to remain above the FOMC's 2.0
percent target for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Furthermore, ongoing
disruptions in supply chains and shipping networks, labor supply constraints,
inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions provide significant
uncertainty over the near-term forecast.

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be
broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. In deriving its March
2022 forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external
forecasts and external data available.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of March 31, 2022. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment rates in the first quarter and the forecasted periods
remained normalized.

The waning pandemic concerns and positive credit performance during the
quarter (described above) were significant drivers of the modeled decreases in
the allowance.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The March 31, 2022 general imprecision
allowance remained relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2021
and reflects uncertainty in the current environment, including the risk of
persistent inflation at elevated levels, geopolitical tension impacts and
supply chain issues.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$1.5 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of March 31, 2022.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 8 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." Net charge-offs decreased $37 million year-over-year,
primarily driven by a decline in net charge-offs in the commercial and
industrial portfolio and commercial investor real estate mortgage portfolio
partially offset by $9 million in net charge-offs from the addition of the
EnerBank. As noted, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment,
volatility in commodity prices, collateral valuations and inflationary
pressure will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in
volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2022 and beyond.
See the "Quarterly Overview" section for details on expectations for net
charge-offs in 2022.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity,
consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under
the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the
result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were
offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and
investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in
interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below
market. Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed
information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"
to the consolidated financial statements.

As provided initially in the CARES Act and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, certain loan modifications related to the
COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief were not considered TDRs and are excluded from the December 31, 2021
disclosures below. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related
allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

| | | | | | |  
  
The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to Ginnie Mae where Regions has the right
but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due
guaranteed loans excluded were $37 million at March 31, 2022 and $49 million
at December 31, 2021.

Non-performing loans at March 31, 2022 decreased compared to year-end levels,
primarily driven by improvements in retail, restaurant, accommodation and
lodging, energy, administrative, support, and waste and repair, as well as,
manufacturing industries.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service
and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers.
Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality
banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center.

The following table summarizes deposits by category:

Table 14--Deposits

| | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| March 31, 2022| | December 31, 2021| |

Total deposits| $| 141,022 | | | $| 139,072 | | |  
| | | | |  
| | | | |  
| | | | |  
  
Total deposits at March 31, 2022 increased approximately $2.0 billion compared
to year-end 2021 levels, driven by non-interest bearing demand, savings and
money market. These increases were offset by a decline in time deposits while
interest-bearing checking remained stable. Although the pace of deposit growth
has slowed compared to 2021 activity, increases across those categories were
primarily driven by seasonality resulting in increased consumer deposit
balances. Time deposits decreased due to maturities, including maturities of
time deposits acquired through EnerBank as these deposits are not being
replaced when they mature, and, to a lesser degree, continued lower interest
rates resulting in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $17.0 billion at March 31, 2022 as compared to $18.3
billion at December 31, 2021. During the first three months of 2022, net
income increased shareholders' equity by $548 million, cash dividends on
common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $159 million, and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $24 million. Changes in
AOCI decreased shareholders' equity by $1.5 billion, primarily due to the net
change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments as a result of significant changes in market interest
rates during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Common stock repurchased
during the first three months of 2022 reduced shareholders' equity $215
million. These shares were immediately retired and therefore are not included
in treasury stock.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized
approach bank. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under the FRB's rules
for tailoring enhanced prudential standards.

Federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on
regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital
was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of
subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year
period beginning in 2022. At March 31, 2022, the net impact of the add-back on
CET1 was approximately $306 million, or approximately 26 basis points. The
add-back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million or 10 basis points
in both 2023 and 2024.

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory requirements:

(1)The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,
and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

The Company's stress capital buffer is floored at 2.5 percent through the
third quarter of 2022.

See the "First Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations of a
range for CET1 during 2022.

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions,
recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and
recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the
"Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section in the 2021
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory Requirements" section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additional discussion is also included in Note 12 "Regulatory Capital
Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the
2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management

Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board.
Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not
limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress
testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral
management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity
regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with
Regions' operating model and risk profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2021 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain items that are included in the financial
results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures
include "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest income",
"adjusted total revenue", "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent basis",
and "adjusted operating leverage ratio". Regions believes that excluding
certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons.
which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating
results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP
financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of
Regions' business because management does not consider the activities related
to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes
that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors
to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by
management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures
as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at
adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) is
presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income
on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented
excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP).
Net interest income (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are
added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP). Net interest
income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a
taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). The adjusted operating leverage ratio
(non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as the
year over year percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis less the year over year percentage change in adjusted total
non-interest expense. Management uses this ratio to monitor performance and
believes it provides meaningful information to investors.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

Net interest income is Regions' principal source of income and is one of the
most important elements of Regions' ability to meet its overall performance
goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by
market interest rates, and in the first quarter of 2022, the FOMC increased
the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points, with additional rate increases expected
in 2022.

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased for the first three
months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in net
interest income was driven primarily by average loan growth and rising
interest rates. Also contributing to the increase was slightly higher hedge-
related income, lower funding costs, and a larger securities portfolio. These
increases were partially offset by a decline in PPP forgiveness income when
compared to first quarter of 2021.

Net interest margin was equal to 2.85 percent and 3.02 percent for the first
three months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline was primarily driven
by continued elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances.

See the "First Quarter Overview" section for the Company's expectations for
interest income as a component of total revenue. See also the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" section below for additional information.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all
rates fall to levels consistent with historical 12-month average rate
minimums. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and
flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual
interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more
realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of March 31, 2022, Regions was asset
sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as
compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending March
2023.

The first quarter of 2022 continued the trend of balance sheet growth in low-
cost deposits observed throughout 2021. Retention of these balance sheet
liquidity inflows is uncertain and some amount of the recent deposit growth
may be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario. Therefore, additional
sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-related "surge" deposit pricing
behavior and retention is outlined in Table 19.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. Currently, net interest income is projected to
benefit from rising short-term interest rates (i.e. asset sensitive profile).
An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds
rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves, 1-month LIBOR, SOFR and BSBY)
will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such
rates higher or lower. Under either environment, it is expected that changes
in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset
the change in asset yields. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge"
deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity
for further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario as
well.

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors. While
this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it represents
a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises. An increase
in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-
term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on
certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective
yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of
premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The
opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest
rates fall. Approximately 70 percent of fixed rate asset production is at the
5-year tenor point or shorter.

Table of Contents

  

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 19 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the
behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is
uncertain. Since year-end 2019, the last period-end free from the effects of
COVID-19, deposit balances have increased by approximately $42 billion,
exclusive of deposits acquired in the EnerBank acquisition, and approximately
$27 billion of the increase was determined to be attributable to pandemic-
related surge deposits. Therefore, Table 19 includes two balance sheet
scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an
opportunity scenario, and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable,
legacy balances, which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second
scenario assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate,
requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the
bank. These deposits, including non-interest bearing products, are attributed
with an approximate 70 percent repricing beta in rising rate scenarios.
Importantly, the impact to net interest income under a changing rate
environment is the same whether the "surge" deposit balances are held at a
higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale
sources. Given the evolving nature of the environment, estimates have been
conservatively derived. Should the balances remain with the Company longer or
demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates, there is potential for upside
(e.g. the opportunity scenario). The disclosure in Table 19 does not prescribe
a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet.

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels
is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case
scenario in Table 19, interest-bearing deposits reprice using an approximately
30 percent beta. The deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate
level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100 basis point shock
outlined in the table below includes an approximate 25 percent to 30 percent
interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the "surge" deposit
interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario, assuming legacy
betas and a 70 percent beta, respectively. Deposit pricing outperformance or
underperformance of 5 percent in that scenario would increase or decrease net
interest income by approximately $31 million, respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from
non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of
the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12
months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 19.

(1)Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward
looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases
and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.

(2)Active cash flow hedges reflected within the measurement horizon (See Table
21 for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates).

(3)Scenario One assumes all deposits (including "surge" deposits) perform
consistently with historical experiences.

(4)Scenario Two accounts for uncertainty in "surge" deposit balances. Assumes
an approximate 70% beta on "surge" balances (approximately $27 billion
projected "surge" deposit balance).

(5)The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a rate shock where all
rates are floored at 12-month average historical lows.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
equal to the historical 12-month average minimum. For example, the 10-year
Treasury yield falls to 81 basis points. The falling rate scenarios in Table
19 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous
shocks under this environment.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity.

Regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives
and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position. At the end of
the first quarter of 2022, as part of its current hedging strategy, the
Company executed $4.2 billion of notional value cash flow hedging derivative
trades (included in Table 20 below) and purchased $1.5 billion in debt
securities available for sale. The cash flow hedging relationships are forward
starting receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps, of which $1.2 billion
will begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the remainder in the first
quarter of 2024. The receive fixed rates on these cash flow hedges ranged from
2.1 to 2.6 percent. The purchased debt securities available for sale consisted
primarily of federal agency and residential agency securities.

The Company continued to add cash flow hedging derivatives and debt securities
available for sale subsequent to March 31, 2022, as part of its hedging
strategy. From April 1, 2022 through May 4, 2022, Regions entered into
approximately $3.5 billion of notional value forward starting cash flow hedges
that have start dates in the third quarter of 2023 and mature within three to
four years of their start dates. The receive fixed rates on these cash flow
hedges ranged from 2.8 to 3.1 percent. In that same time period, Regions also
purchased approximately $700 million of debt securities available for sale
consisting primarily of federal agency and residential agency securities.

See further discussion below regarding hedging derivatives executed during
first quarter of 2022.

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A

Table of Contents

  

Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar
futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in
interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is
minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps
are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for
variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal
is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest
settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to
purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time.
Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market
instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign
currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a
specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf
of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another
party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its
fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate
position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer

70

Table of Contents

  

transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual
transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the
counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into
legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one
transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master
netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and
loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that
counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions
are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades
effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing
Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the
respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in this report contains
more information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.

See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-
end derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use
after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or
2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31, 2021.
Regions successfully remediated contracts referencing 1-week or 2-month USD
LIBOR prior to December 31, 2021. Additionally, Regions ceased origination of
all new LIBOR-based lending prior to December 31, 2021. Existing contracts
referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than June
30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance
of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate
obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark
rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in settings other than
1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition
Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant
business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this program, the
Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the
discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks associated with the
transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR Steering Committee.
Regions is following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates
and is operationally ready to offer new benchmarks as they are adopted by
regulatory agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

•The discontinuation of LIBOR-based commercial lending prior to December 31,
2021, consistent with regulatory guidelines. The Company is providing multiple
alternative rates based on market competition and demand, including SOFR,
BSBY, and AMERIBOR.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

Regions has exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several lines of
business. As of March 31, 2022, Regions had the following exposures that
reference LIBOR:

•Approximately $30.4 billion of total outstanding commercial and investor real
estate loans and approximately $858 million of total consumer loans;

•Securities within the investment portfolio of approximately $285 million;

•Notional amount of interest rate derivatives totaling approximately $135
billion;

71

Table of Contents

  

•Series B and C preferred stock with total carrying values of $433 million and
$490 million, respectively that reference LIBOR when their dividend rate
begins to float after 2023.

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into law with
the purpose of establishing a clear and uniform process for replacing LIBOR in
existing contracts. Among the provisions of this legislation, contracts may be
transitioned to SOFR to gain a legal safe harbor. The Company has assessed the
impact of this legislation and expects to allow certain clients to fallback to
SOFR upon the cessation of LIBOR, consistent with the guidelines in the
legislation.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers.
Regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain liquidity sources and
reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions
maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further
described below. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including
scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate
levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity
base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans,
and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in
the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by
Regions' relatively steady deposit base.

The securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of
liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of
securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements).
Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the portfolio (for example, the
agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash
through various secured borrowing arrangements. Cash reserves, liquid assets
and secured borrowing capabilities (including borrowing capacity at the FHLB,
as discussed below) aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed
conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations
related to potential litigation. See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements. Liquidity needs can also be met by
borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits
on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such
markets.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At March 31, 2022, Regions
had approximately $25.7 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB and other
depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $28.1 billion at
December 31, 2021, due to the use of active cash management strategies used to
deploy increases in deposit balances. The average balance held with the FRB
was approximately $26.6 billion and $16.5 billion for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to the "Cash and Cash
Equivalents" section for more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of March 31, 2022, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $14.9 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2022, Regions had
no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $16.3 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain
eligible securities and loans as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances.
Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of
outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a
reliable and economical source of funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial
statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash
sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other
cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.1 billion at March 31, 2022.
Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk

Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO
regularly review compliance with the established limits.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber
attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in
attempts to compromise or disable information systems. Such attempts have
increased in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue for a number
of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used
by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attempts and malicious traffic from
outside the U.S. However, the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer
transactions. The related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new
cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies
on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and
although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security
capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase
exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The benefit from credit losses totaled $36 million
in the first quarter of 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $142
million during the first quarter of 2021. Refer to the "Allowance" section for
further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. Capital markets income decreased in the first
quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to decreases
in securities underwriting and placement, M&A advisory fees, and commercial
swap income. M&A advisory fees were impacted by timing of transactions.
Additionally, debt and real estate capital markets were impacted by
uncertainty surrounding interest rates, geopolitical tensions and volatility
in credit spreads. The declines were partially offset by an increase in loan
syndication revenue.

Investment management and trust fee income--Investment management and trust
fee income represents income from asset management services provided to
individuals, businesses and institutions. Investment management and trust fee
income increased due primarily to increased production and sales, and positive
market-related impacts on asset values in the first quarter of 2022.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage
income in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was
due primarily to lower mortgage production as a result of higher interest
rates. Additionally, mortgage income was impacted by reductions in the
valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedges. Mortgage income in
the first quarter of 2022 also included approximately $12 million in gains
associated with the re-securitization and sale of Ginnie Mae loans previously
repurchased from their pools.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets decreased in the first quarter of 2022 compared to
the same period in 2021 due to market volatility. The adjustments are offset
in salaries and benefits.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check
fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the first quarter
of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 primarily due to an increase in
commercial loan and leasing related fee income generated from Ascentium and an
increase in other consumer income.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Full-time equivalent headcount increased to 19,723 at March
31, 2022 from 18,926 at March 31, 2021, reflecting the additional associates
from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021. While headcount increased,
salaries and employee benefits expense remained stable primarily due to lower
incentive compensation during the first quarter of 2022.

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses--Professional, legal, and
regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other
professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal, and regulatory
expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in
2021 primarily due to a decline in legal fees.

Credit/Checkcard expenses--Credit/Checkcard expenses include credit and
checkcard fraud and expenses. Credit/checkcard increased in the first quarter
of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an accrual
increase associated with a previous debit card matter.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was
$154 million compared to $180 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.9 percent for both periods. See
the "First Quarter Overview" for the Company's near-term expectations for
future tax rates.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance
income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the
effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but
are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain
leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and
changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the
effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

At March 31, 2022, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $136
million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $306 million at December
31, 2021. The change in the net deferred tax position was due primarily to the
deferred tax impact of unrealized losses on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments arising during the period.

ACQUISITIONS

EnerBank

On October 1, 2021, Regions completed its acquisition of home improvement
lender EnerBank. The acquisition of EnerBank allows Regions to provide
customers with home improvement financing solutions using EnerBank's loan
programs and digital solutions to support a wide range of home improvement
needs.

As a result of the acquisition, Regions recorded approximately $3.3 billion of
assets of which $3.1 billion were loans that are included in Regions' other
consumer loan portfolio. Regions also assumed $2.8 billion of liabilities,
consisting almost entirely of time deposits that the Company expects will
attrite over time. The premiums recorded related to the acquired assets and
assumed liabilities were immaterial.

Fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of March 31, 2022. Fair
value estimates, including loans, intangible assets and goodwill, are subject
to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional
information becomes available.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $198 million as a result of the acquisition.
Regions recorded an immaterial ALLL related to these loans, which was included
in the total acquired asset value as part of the acquisition.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions recognized initial goodwill of
$361 million and other intangible assets of $176 million. The other intangible
assets were primarily comprised of customer relationship intangibles and will
be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized asset.

Sabal

On December 1, 2021, Regions completed its acquisition of Sabal, a financial
services firm that leverages technology to facilitate off-balance-sheet
lending in the small balance commercial real estate market.

As a result of the acquisition, Regions recorded approximately $360 million of
assets, which included loans held for sale totaling $82 million, as well as a
commercial mortgage servicing asset and securities that were immaterial.
Regions also assumed $114 million of liabilities, consisting primarily of
borrowings that were paid off following closing.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions recognized initial goodwill of
$146 million and other intangible assets that were immaterial.

Fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of March 31, 2022. Fair
value estimates, including acquired assets and goodwill, are subject to change
for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information
becomes available.

Item 3\. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The information presented in the "Market Risk" section of Part 1, Item 2 is

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risks, including the risk factors
discussed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the "2021 Form 10-K"), which risk
factors have not materially changed except as set forth below. The risk
factors below supersede the similarly captioned risk factors set forth in the
2021 Form 10-K and supplement the other risk factors in the 2021 Form 10-K.
They reflect modifications to the nature of the risks that have developed
since the date on which the 2021 Form 10-K was filed.

Our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

We provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as
well as other financial services including asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and
other specialty financing. All of our businesses are materially affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the South,
Midwest and Texas, the principal markets in which we conduct business. Global
economic conditions also affect our operating results because global economic
conditions directly influence the U.S. economic conditions. Sources of global
economic and market instability include, but are not limited to, the potential
for an economic slowdown in United Kingdom, Europe and the United States; the
impact of trade negotiations; economic conditions in China, including the
global economic impacts of the Chinese economy and China's regulation of
commerce; and escalating military tensions in Europe as a result of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. Various market conditions also affect our operating
results. Certain changes in interest rates, inflation, or the financial
markets could affect demand for our products. A worsening of business and
economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in
which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business,
including the following:

•A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other
products and services offered by us;

•A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by
consumer or commercial real estate;

•An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;

•A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in
interest rates; and

•An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become
delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their
loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses, and
valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

In the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can
be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would
intervene. Further, the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic (including variant
strains and resurgences of the COVID-19 virus) and its effects on the U.S. and
global economy remains uncertain, as does the success of any measures taken or
that may be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which ultimately may
not be sufficient to address the specific effects of the pandemic or avert
severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. If economic conditions
worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation,
which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially
contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may enhance or
contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher
inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce
demand for the our products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the
Company's borrowers or result in lower values for our investment securities
and other interest-earning assets. In response to sustained inflationary
pressures, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points on
March 16, 2022 and by an additional 50 basis points on May 4, 2022. The
Federal Reserve has also signaled its intention to continue to raise interest
rates over the course of 2022 and has announced that it will begin to taper
its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and treasury securities. To
the extent these policies do not mitigate the volatility and uncertainty
related to inflation and the effects of inflation, or to the extent conditions
otherwise worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.

Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which
is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning
assets (primarily loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held
at the FRB) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-
bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net
interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-
earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the
spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities.
These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by
external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and
deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC and interest rates markets.

77

* * *

Table of Contents

  

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based
on market-based liquidity and short-term interest rates, the level of which is
influenced heavily by the FOMC's monetary policy. However, the yields
generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both short-term
and longer-term interest rates. Longer-term rates are affected by multiple
factors including the actions of the FOMC such as quantitative easing or
tightening, as well as the market's expectations for future inflation, growth
and other economic considerations. The level of net interest income is,
therefore, influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the
shape of the yield curve. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains
or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our
interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates
on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline. Our net
interest income would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our
interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on
our interest-bearing liabilities.

The low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal
Reserve increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points
on March 16, 2022 and by an additional 50 basis points on May 4, 2022. The
Federal Reserve has signaled that there will be additional federal funds
interest rate increases during the remainder of 2022. While an increasing rate
environment would have a positive impact on net interest income, increasing
rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers
and may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually
obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our
results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected
as a result. Conversely, should interest rates move lower, we would expect
modest declines in net interest income over the next twelve months given the
protection that remains in place from the Company's interest rate hedging
program.

For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies
for these risks, see the "First Quarter Overview", "Net Interest Income and
Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Securities" sections of Item 2.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the "Executive
Overview", "Net Interest Income, Margin and Interest Rate Risk," "Net Interest
Income and Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Securities" sections
of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an
adverse impact on our operations.

We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and
examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the
businesses in which we may permissibly engage. The laws and regulations
governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our
depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund,
not our shareholders or other creditors. These laws and regulations govern a
variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control,
maintenance of adequate capital, and general business operations and financial
condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and
investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on
dividends and repurchases of our capital securities, establishment of branch
offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). Further,
we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many
activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict
us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can be no assurance that any
regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained.

Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing
continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such
changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed
at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions
Bank and our subsidiaries, including any changes resulting from the recent
change in U.S. presidential administration and change in control of the U.S.
Senate.

In addition, as climate change issues become more prevalent, the U.S. and
foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues. The increasing
governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental
regulations, including disclosure required by the SEC, that could result in
additional compliance costs.

Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and
governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect
us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to
appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could
result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to
our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Our regulatory capital position is
discussed in greater detail in the "Regulatory Requirements" section in Item
1. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations of
this Form 10-Q and Note 12 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions"
to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2021.
