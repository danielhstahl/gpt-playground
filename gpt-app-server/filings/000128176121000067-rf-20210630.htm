Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions
may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the
actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in
those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that
are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including
the scope and duration of the pandemic (including any resurgences), actions
taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and their
success, the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines, and the direct and
indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather
are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and
information available to, management at the time the statements are made.
Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various
risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to
inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such
statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but
are not limited to, those described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the global
economy, has and could continue to adversely affect our capital and liquidity
position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and
increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result
in lost revenue or additional expenses. The pandemic could also result in
goodwill impairment charges and the impairment of other financial and
nonfinancial assets, and increase our cost of capital.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of changes in tax laws, including the effect of any future
interpretations of existing tax law or any enactment of new domestic tax
legislation and corporate tax rates, which may impact our earnings, capital
ratios and our ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as
changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by
applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of
the recent change in U.S. presidential administration and control of the U.S.
Congress, which could require us to change certain business practices,
increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us,
or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments,
must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with
applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements
and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our
ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our business.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses, including our pending acquisition of EnerBank and risks related to
such acquisition including: the possibility that regulatory and other
approvals and conditions are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at
all, or contain unanticipated terms and conditions; delays in closing the
proposed transaction; expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or
other benefits may not be realized within the expected timeframes or might be
less than projected; difficulties in integrating the business; and the
inability of Regions to effectively cross-sell products to EnerBank's
customers.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our business such
as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other
service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of
operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act or
failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our business on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and impact of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could
impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce
demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our

6

business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of
confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage to our systems,
increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit
rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic
conditions that we are not able to predict.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions
Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

See also the reports filed with the SEC, including the discussion under the
"Risk Factors" section of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter

Debt securities with carrying values of $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion at June
30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, were pledged to secure public
funds, trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements. Included within
total pledged securities is approximately $24 million of encumbered U.S.
Treasury securities at both June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at June 30, 2021, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 129 at December 31, 2020, to 321 at June 30, 2021.
The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of unrealized
losses from year-end 2020 was primarily due to changes in market interest
rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication
of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables
above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no individual
unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented credit
impairment as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is
not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the
positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at
maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale were immaterial for the three and six months ended June 30,
2021 and 2020. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating
impairment, management did not identify any positions where impairment was
believed to exist in either of the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 or
2020.

Total consumer| 28,572 | | | 29,428 |  
Total loans, net of unearned income| $| 84,074 | | | $| 85,266 |  
  
During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, Regions purchased
approximately $532 million and $902 million in indirect-other consumer,
residential first mortgage and commercial and industrial loans from third
parties, respectively.

At June 30, 2021, $15.2 billion in securities and net eligible loans held by
Regions were pledged for potential borrowings from the FHLB. At June 30, 2021,
an additional $12.8 billion in net eligible loans held by Regions were pledged
to the FRB for potential borrowings.

Table of Contents

  

Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance are sales-type and
direct financing leases totaling $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2021, with
related income of $31 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, for a description of the methodology.

As of June 30, 2021, Regions' total loans included $2.9 billion of PPP loans.
These loans are guaranteed by the Federal government and as the guarantee is
not separable from the loans, Regions recorded an immaterial allowance on
these loans.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, Regions decreased the allowance by
$609 million to $1.7 billion, which represents management's best estimate of
expected losses over the life of the portfolio. The decrease was due primarily
to continued improvement in the economic outlook due to vaccine deployment,
lower expectations of future credit losses due to the benefit of government
stimulus programs, and impact of expected charge-offs that were previously
provided for. While the allowance estimate reflects these benefits, elevated
levels of imprecision remain due to continued uncertainty regarding the timing
of full economic recovery.

Macroeconomic factors utilized in the CECL loss models include, but are not
limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, HPI and the S&P 500 index, with
unemployment being the most significant macroeconomic factor. Regions' models
are sensitive to changes in the economic scenarios. The June 30, 2021 economic
forecast was relatively consistent with the March 2021 forecast with the
exception of the HPI which had meaningful increases during the quarter. Risks
to the economic forecast and the model limitations are considered through
model adjustments and the qualitative framework.

The following tables present analyses of the allowance by portfolio segment
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate and consumer.
Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for information regarding Regions' portfolio segments
and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal

underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans.
Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for
various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an
updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop
the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less
probability of default and vice versa.

The following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, by vintage year
as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Classes in the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes
in the consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer
to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information regarding Regions'
credit quality indicators.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding the Company's
TDRs, including their impact on the allowance and designation of TDRs in
periods subsequent to the modification.

As provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed into law on December
27, 2020, which extended initial guidance provided in the CARES Act, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act relief and short-term nature of most
COVID-19 deferrals precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan
modifications from being classified as TDRs as of June 30, 2021 and December
31, 2020.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Carrying value, end of period| $| 392 | | | $| 249 | | | $| 392 | | | $| 249 |  
________

(1)"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology
is a discounted net cash flow approach.

  

In the six months ended 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased the rights to
service residential mortgage loans on a flow basis for approximately $37
million and $16 million, respectively.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| June 30  
| 2021| | 2020  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 35,519 | | | $| 33,575 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 10.5 | %| | 17.0 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (27)| | | $| (25)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (49)| | | $| (44)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 571| | 626 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (9)| | | $| (5)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (19)| | | $| (11)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.7 | %| | 4.1 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 292| | 280  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.3 | | | 27.4 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 11 for additional information.

_________

(1)Dividends on all series of preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are
payable quarterly in arrears.

(2)The shares were fully redeemed on June 15, 2021.

(3)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR
plus 3.536%.

(4)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to August 15, 2029, 5.700%, and (ii) for
each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029, three-month LIBOR plus
3.148%.

(5)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2025, 5.750%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2025, the five-year
treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date plus
5.426%.

All series of preferred stock have no stated maturity and redemption is solely
at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part,
after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, at any time
following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B, Series C,
Series D, and Series E preferred stock.

The Board declared a total of $46 million in cash dividends on Series A,
Series B, and Series C preferred stock during both the first six months of
2021 and 2020. The Board declared $11 million in cash dividends on Series D
preferred stock during the first six months of 2021; the initial quarterly
dividend for Series D was declared in the third quarter of 2020 and there were
no cash dividends for the first six months of 2020. Therefore, a total of $57
million in cash dividends on total preferred stock was declared in the first
six months of 2021. The initial quarterly dividend date for the Series E
preferred stock is September 15, 2021, therefore there were no cash dividends
for Series E preferred stock for the first six months of 2021.

On May 4, 2021, Regions completed the issuance of $400 million in depositary
shares each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the
Company's 4.45% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series E, par value
$1.00 per share ("Series E preferred stock"), with a liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share of Series E preferred stock (equivalent to $25.00 per
depositary share). The Company incurred $10 million of issuance costs
associated with the transaction. Dividends will be paid quarterly at an annual
rate equal to 4.45% for each period beginning September 15, 2021.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed all 500,000
outstanding shares of Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and
the corresponding depositary fractional shares at par for $500 million. Upon
redemption, additional paid in capital was reduced by $100 million related to
Series A preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred
stock, including related surplus, and net income available to common
shareholders was reduced by $13 million related to issuance costs.

In the event Series B, Series C, Series D or Series E preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $67 million, $10 million, $4 million, or
$10 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to common shareholders'
equity. The remaining amounts listed represent issuance costs that were
recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will
be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

Regions was not required to participate in the 2021 CCAR; the Company chose to
participate in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB.
Regions received the results of the voluntary test on June 28, 2021. The
Federal Reserve communicated that the Company exceeded all minimum capital
levels under the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Stress Test. Effective October
1, 2021, Regions' preliminary SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2021
through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
As of June 30, 2021, Regions had repurchased approximately 8.0 million shares
of common stock under this plan which reduced shareholders' equity by $167
million. Included in the share repurchases are approximately 1.0 million
shares that were repurchased as part of the amendment to the Company's
deferred investment plan for its directors. All of these shares were
immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore, will not be included in
treasury stock. The Company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of
2021 or throughout 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the second quarter of 2021.
Therefore, Regions declared $0.155 per share in cash dividends for both the
first and second quarters of 2021 and 2020, totaling $0.31 per common share
for the first six months of 2021 and 2020.

In the third quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve lifted restrictions on
quarterly per share common dividends on banks whose capital remains above
required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR cycle. On July 21, 2021, the Board
approved a 10 percent increase to the third quarter common stock dividend to
$0.17 per share.

The effects from the assumed exercise of 4 million in stock options,
restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units for both the
three months and six months ended June 30, 2021 was not included in the above
computations of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would
have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, basic and diluted weighted-
average common shares outstanding for earnings (loss) per common share are the
same due to net losses.

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Includes accrued interest of $21 million at June 30, 2021 and $28 million
at December 31, 2020, respectively.

(3)Includes accrued interest of $8 million at June 30, 2021 and $12 million at
December 31, 2020, respectively.

(4)Estimated fair value includes premium of approximately $44 million as of
June 30, 2021 and $83 million as of December 31, 2020 to be amortized over the
remaining life. Approximately $32 million of the decrease since December 31,
2020 related to hedges that were terminated during the first six months of
2021 and were not amortized into earnings as of the date of termination.

(5)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements, and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

(6)The gain amounts, which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or
reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other
derivative positions. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, financial
instruments posted of $24 million, for both periods, were not offset in the
consolidated balance sheets.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors. As of June 30, 2021, Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions through 2026.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company terminated
$250 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, in notional of floor hedges.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company terminated
$3.0 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, in notional of swap hedges. The
following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges on
AOCI. The balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI will be amortized
into earnings through 2025.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Regions had $806 million and $924
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
Regions had $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage
income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and
corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans
are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2022 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2021 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of June 30, 2021 was approximately $537 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at June 30, 2021 and
2020 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were $115 million and $74 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $116 million and $74
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis:

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for residential mortgage
servicing rights, which are the only material assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated with the
intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the
changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also elected to measure certain commercial and industrial loans
held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively traded in the
secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for
substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation service that
is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans are traded in
the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject to variability
and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these loans held for
sale was immaterial at June 30, 2021.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. These changes in
fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial
portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific
credit risk.

_________

(1)Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

(2)The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value premium on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at June 30,
2021 was $652 million or 0.8 percent.

(3)Excluded from this table is the sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged
lease carrying amount of $1.4 billion at June 30, 2021.

(4)Excluded from this table is the operating lease carrying amount of $163
million at June 30, 2021.

(1)Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

(2)The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value premium on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at December 31,
2020 was $1.2 billion or 1.4 percent.

(3)Excluded from this table is the sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged
lease carrying amount of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020.

(4)Excluded from this table is the operating lease carrying amount of $200
million at December 31, 2020.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior period was updated to reflect
these enhancements. In the first quarter of 2021, the net interest income
allocation methodology was enhanced. All net interest income including the FTP
offset, activities of the treasury function, securities portfolio and interest
rate risk activities is allocated to the three reporting segments.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| June 30, 2021| | December 31, 2020  
| (In millions)  
Unused commitments to extend credit| $| 60,626 | | | $| 56,644 |  
Standby letters of credit| 1,773 | | | 1,742 |  
Commercial letters of credit| 42 | | | 132 |  
Liabilities associated with standby letters of credit| 31 | | | 25 |  
Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 31 | | | 25 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 87 | | | 126 |  
  
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
June 30, 2021, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could incur
no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available information
changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the
estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether

47

* * *

Table of Contents

  

discovery has begun or is not complete; whether meaningful settlement
discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class
allegations. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more
complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially
in the early stages of the proceeding when it is not known whether a class
will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As
a result, Regions may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with
respect to some of the matters disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated
amount discussed above may not include an estimate for every matter disclosed
below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. As previously disclosed,
Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the CFPB into certain of
Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional inquiries will arise
from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries
could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or
enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material
effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments,
findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third for the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the
Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $4.8 billion and $4.5
billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability
related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5
billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company
would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for
Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default
and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without
value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $5 million at both June 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for
additional information.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K. See
Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements"
to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of
this discussion will be on the three and six months ended June 30, 2021
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 for the consolidated
statements of income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of
this discussion will be the balances as of June 30, 2021 compared to December
31, 2020.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 7 through 9 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At June 30, 2021, Regions operated 1,313 total branch outlets. Regions
carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable
business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with
the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment Information" to the
consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions'
segment reporting structure.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

On February 27, 2020, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement
to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company
headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and
included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses.
Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail.

On June 8, 2021, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement to
acquire EnerBank USA, a consumer lending institution specializing in home
improvement lending headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The transaction is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory
approval.

SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. The July 2021 baseline forecast anticipates real
GDP

51

* * *

Table of Contents

  

growth of 6.1 percent in 2021, 5.3 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023.
The initial estimate for the second quarter 2021 GDP was released on July 29,
2021, which confirmed the July baseline forecast assumption that the aggregate
level of real GDP would return to the pre-pandemic levels of the fourth
quarter of 2019. While the downside risks posed by the COVID-19 virus have not
been eliminated, they nonetheless have declined with further progress on the
vaccination front. Further reopening of the economy and significant fiscal and
monetary support are expected to sustain rapid growth over coming quarters on
the heels of the 6.4 percent annualized real GDP growth seen in the first
quarter of 2021. However, recent increases in COVID-19 case counts in Regions'
footprint, and the progression of variants, have the potential to increase
uncertainty in the outlook and are therefore being monitored closely. That
said, Regions continues to expect that by year-end 2022 the economy will be
back on the path of growth around 2.0 percent that prevailed prior to the
pandemic. As has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, there remains
a heightened degree of uncertainty around economic forecasts being made at
present.

An increasingly common theme in the economic data over recent months is the
growing imbalance between the demand side of the economy and the supply side.
Thanks to an unprecedented degree of fiscal and monetary policy support,
greater numbers of people being vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, and the
lifting of restrictions on economic activity, the demand side of the economy
is notably robust. The supply side of the economy, however, is unable to keep
pace. Shortages of labor and non-labor inputs and shipping bottlenecks are
driving up costs to producers and acting as drags on output growth, and the
growing imbalance between demand and supply has contributed to the sharp
acceleration in inflation over recent months.

Supply and demand imbalances are evident in the labor market. As of June 2021,
the level of nonfarm employment was 6.8 million jobs below the pre-pandemic
peak, while there are 3.4 million fewer people in the labor force than was the
case prior to the pandemic. Yet, there are over nine million open jobs waiting
to be filled, and it seems clear that firms would be hiring more workers were
they able to. While labor supply constraints should begin easing over coming
months, in the interim they are leading to more upward pressure on wages than
would seem consistent with the remaining degree of labor market slack, with
average hourly earnings rising across all broad industry groups. With the
various rounds of pandemic-related stimulus payments having largely run their
course, labor earnings will resume their role as the main driver of growth in
personal income.

The acceleration in the growth of labor income comes at a time when the
personal saving rate remains significantly elevated, with an estimated $2.4
trillion more in household saving than would have been the case had pre-
pandemic income and saving trends been maintained. Households have also been
paring down debt to the point that, as of the first quarter of 2021, the level
of non-mortgage debt was below the pre-pandemic level. As such, conditions are
in place for continued growth in consumer spending over coming quarters.
Residential investment is expected to be a support for real GDP growth over
coming quarters, but to a lesser degree than had previously been the case.
Despite mortgage interest rates remaining favorable, notably lean inventories
have fueled rapid house price appreciation over the past year, thus eroding
affordability. Along with some easing in demand, improvement on the supply
side of the market is expected to result in a moderation in the pace of house
price appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2021 and subsequent quarters.

As measured by the CPI, inflation hit 5.4 percent in June 2021, with core
inflation hitting 4.5 percent, the highest rate of core inflation since
November 1991. While some factors behind the acceleration in inflation over
recent months, such as base effects and the normalization of services prices,
will fade in the months ahead, supply chain bottlenecks, higher shipping
costs, and higher labor costs could be sources of more persistent inflation
pressures. As such, while inflation is expected to slow from current rates, it
is likely to remain easily above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target rate into 2022.
That said, the FOMC continues to believe that inflation pressures are mostly
transitory which, along with their stated willingness to let inflation run
above their target rate for "some time," makes it unlikely they will respond
to higher inflation. While it is expected that the FOMC will begin tapering
the pace of the Fed's monthly asset purchases in early-2022, no changes in the
Fed funds rate target range are expected until mid-2023. As such, monetary
policy is expected to remain accommodative over the forecast horizon.

The July baseline forecast incorporates the infrastructure bill which has
garnered bipartisan support in Congress, which would result in approximately
$579 billion in spending above what has previously been assumed. While there
is scope for further fiscal policy measures, at present there are no specific
details on either the spending or tax measures and, as such, no such changes
are incorporated into the current baseline forecast. It should also be noted
that expectations of the potential economic effects of the infrastructure bill
and any additional spending should be tempered by the fact that any such
spending would be phased in over an eight-to-ten year period and would be at
least partially offset by tax increases. As such, the net effect on GDP growth
in any single year over the 2022-2029 period would be relatively small.

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be
broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. Those parts of the
footprint, most notably Florida, traditionally more reliant on travel and
tourism are benefiting from further reopening of the economy and increased
mobility. While an above-average exposure to manufacturing across much of the
footprint will be a tailwind to growth within the footprint, supply chain and
logistics bottlenecks mean that growth will be slower than would otherwise be
the case. To the extent remote working remains part of the post-pandemic
landscape, states such as Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and
Texas that have consistently benefited from above average degrees of in-
migration should continue to do so, which will provide support to the broader
economies of these states.

The continued signs of economic improvement, with consideration of uncertainty
inherent in the forecast, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating
the ACL as of June 30, 2021. See the "Allowance" section for further
information.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the
economic environment in which the Company operates. In the second quarter of
2021, the economic forecast continued to show signs of recovery. While some
uncertainty remains, the economic forecast shows a much more positive outlook
as the economy is more fully reopen. There are select areas where the COVID-19
pandemic impacted second quarter conditions, as discussed below. Regions
expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and
the Company's financial results in future quarters, albeit at a diminishing
rate.

Regions is in the process of implementing a phased approach to return remote
working associates to office locations. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 85
percent of the Company's non-branch associates are working remotely.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Company continued to offer financial
assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial hardships
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering special
COVID-related payment deferral or forbearance programs for the Company's
mortgage and home equity loan customers.

Regions' outstanding deferrals have declined 95 percent since the initial
relief provided in early 2020 from $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 to $269
million as of June 30, 2021. Of total outstanding deferrals, 71 percent are
related to residential mortgages that are government guaranteed.

As a certified SBA lender, Regions provided its customers with the loan
process under the PPP. Program funding ended in the second quarter of 2021 and
the forgiveness process is ongoing. Regions originated PPP loans totaling
approximately $6.2 billion, of which approximately 38,100 loans totaling
approximately $2.9 billion remained outstanding as of June 30, 2021. Regions
expects that approximately 80% of the total $6.2 billion of PPP loans will be
forgiven by year-end 2021.

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the
Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has
ample sources of liquidity that include a stable deposit base, cash balances
held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank,
unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the
Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders'
Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. Due to changes in
customer behavior, combined with continued enhancements to overdraft practices
and transaction postings, the Company estimates consumer service charges will
remain 10 percent to 15 percent below pre-pandemic levels. See Table 24 "Non-
Interest Income" for more detail.

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail.

Capital

During the third quarter of 2020, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement
for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0
percent. In the second quarter of 2021, Regions received the results of the
Company's voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR. The FRB communicated that the
Company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test
and the Company's stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of 2021 through
the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

In the third quarter of 2021, the FRB lifted restrictions on dividends that
were put in place in previous periods in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On
July 21, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of
2021 of $0.17 per share of common stock, which was in compliance with the
FRB's SCB framework.

The Company intends to operate at a range for CET1 of 9.25 percent to 9.75
percent, with the expectation to manage to the mid-point by year-end 2021. The
Company regularly performs internal stress testing which can result in
modifications to the operating range.

Second Quarter Results

Regions reported net income (loss) available to common shareholders of $748
million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2021 compared to
$(237) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2020.

For the second quarter of 2021, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $975 million, down $10 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 2.81 percent for the
second quarter of 2021 and 3.19 percent in the second quarter of 2020. The
decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in average
loan balances and re-mixing into lower yielding lending portfolios. Net
interest margin was negatively impacted by excess cash balances due to
continued deposit growth as well as the repricing of fixed-rate loan and
securities

portfolios at lower market interest rates. Refer to Table 20 "Consolidated
Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis" for further details.

The benefit from credit losses totaled $337 million in the second quarter of
2021, as compared to a provision of $882 million during the second quarter of
2020. The current quarter benefit was primarily due to continuing improvement
in credit metrics, continued improvement in the economic forecast, vaccine
deployment and the impact of expected charge-offs previously provided for.
Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $47 million, or an annualized 0.23 percent of average
loans, in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $182 million, or an
annualized 0.80 percent for the second quarter of 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

The allowance was 2.00 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at June
30, 2021 compared to 2.69 percent at December 31, 2020. The decrease was
impacted by the factors discussed above. The allowance was 253 percent of
total non-performing loans at June 30, 2021 compared to 308 percent at
December 31, 2020. Total non-performing loans (excluding loans held for sale)
declined to 0.79 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at June 30,
2021 compared to 0.87 percent at December 31, 2020. Refer to the "Allowance
for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $619 million for the second quarter of 2021, a $46
million increase from the second quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by increases in service charges, card and ATM fees and other
miscellaneous income. The increases were partially offset by declines in
mortgage income and capital markets income. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Income"
for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $898 million in the second quarter of 2021, a
$26 million decrease from the second quarter of 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by lower professional, legal and regulatory expenses and
branch consolidation, property and equipment charges. See Table 25 "Non-
Interest Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $231 million
compared to a $47 million benefit for the same period in 2020. See "Income
Taxes" toward the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of
this report for more detail.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $7.6 billion from year-end
2020 to June 30, 2021, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with
the FRB. Excess liquidity from deposit growth is held at the FRB. Deposit
growth was primarily driven by consumer deposits from government stimulus
payments and new account growth during the first six months of 2021. See the
"Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more information.

| $| 30,283 | | | $| 28,276 | | | |  
  
Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Debt securities increased $2.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to June 30,
2021. The increase from year-end was primarily the result of the purchase of
approximately $2.0 billion in U.S treasury securities, mortgage-backed
securities and corporate and other debt securities during the second quarter
of 2021.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $1.2 billion at June 30, 2021, consisting of $976
million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $118 million of commercial
mortgage and other loans, and $99 million of non-performing loans. At December
31, 2020, loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion
of residential real estate mortgage loans, $460 million of commercial mortgage
and other loans, and $6 million of non-performing loans. In the fourth quarter
of 2020, Regions made the decision to sell a certain portfolio of $239 million
commercial and industrial loans, which were reclassified to held for sale as
of December 31, 2020. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company decided not
to sell the respective loans; therefore, effective June 1, 2021, the remaining
balance of approximately $193 million was reclassified back to the loan
portfolio. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans
held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations fluctuate
depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2020 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to
Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding Regions'
portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

While the economic environment continues to improve as the economy re-opens,
there are select industries that continue to experience impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See Table 3 and Table 4 below for more detail.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans decreased $242 million since year-end 2020. The June 30,
2021 balance includes $2.9 billion of PPP loans, a decrease of $676 million
compared to year-end 2020, reflecting an acceleration in PPP forgiveness in
the second quarter. While line utilization levels remain well below pre-
pandemic levels, utilization is believed to have reached an inflection point
late in the second quarter.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations.
Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to
commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

Table of Contents

  

Regions has identified certain industry sectors within the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to
COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the second quarter of 2021,
which narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to year-end 2020. As of
June 30, 2021, these high-risk industries include energy, consumer services
and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Identified COVID-19 high-risk
balances have declined $2.5 billion from $5.2 billion at year-end 2020 to $2.7
billion as of June 30, 2021.

Industries and sub-sectors identified as high-risk may change in future
periods depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over
time. These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within
these industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. Regions is closely monitoring
customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers.
All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless
specifically identified as IRE. PPP loan balances are not included in Table 4
as these loans are not considered high risk, as they are fully guaranteed by
the U.S. government.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans decreased $15 million in comparison to 2020 year-
end balances.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $476 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances.
The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an
increase in originations due to continued historically low market interest
rates. Approximately $3.2 billion in new loan originations were retained on
the balance sheet through the first six months of 2021.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $482 million in comparison to 2020 year-end
balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions'
branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home
equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment
upon maturity or a 5-year draw

period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means
there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for
interest-only lines of credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of June
30, 2021. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans
decreased by $125 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which was lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio decreased $313 million from year-end 2020 as
Regions has discontinued its indirect auto lending business. The Company
remains in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through
third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio decreased $274
million from year-end 2020 due to exiting a third party relationship during
the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $82 million from
year-end 2020 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as well as
elevated payment rates.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $56 million from year-
end 2020.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" .

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Discussion of the methodology
used to calculate the allowance is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, as well as related discussion in Management's
Discussion and Analysis.

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to
external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by
changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate
demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health
pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural
disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

The allowance totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2021 compared to $2.3 billion
at December 31, 2020, which represents management's best estimate of expected
losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers
of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 7 below. While many of
these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most
relevant.

_______

(1)This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-
off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans.. This line
item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2021,
which are fully backed by the U.S. government and have an immaterial
associated allowance.

(2)This balance includes $64 million related to the initial allowance for non-
PCD loans acquired as part of the Ascentium acquisition. Impact included only
for the quarter of acquisition.

(3)Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and
recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a
reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets in the
first quarter of 2020.

  

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions'
internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The second quarter of
2021 exhibited strong

asset quality performance, reflecting broad-based improvements across most
portfolios. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances decreased
approximately $534 million, classified balances decreased $243 million, and
total net charge-offs decreased $36 million compared to the first quarter of
2021. Non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, decreased approximately
$72 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, while non-performing assets
increased modestly. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well and the
HPI showed robust appreciation. Regions continued to perform a bottom-up
review of loan portfolios during the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in
fewer sectors considered high-risk compared to the first quarter of 2021. As
of June 30, 2021, $2.7 billion of commercial and investor real estate loans
are in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments, a decline of $700 million from
March 31, 2021. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more
information about the high-risk industries. As the credit risk within Regions'
loan portfolio continues to be evaluated, both negative and positive factors
of the economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance
estimate.

As economic activity accelerated due to widespread reopening of the economy,
the second quarter of 2021 showed continued signs of economic improvement.
Regions' June 2021 forecast was relatively consistent with the March 2021
forecast with the exception of HPI which saw meaningful increases. Regions'
economic forecast utilized in the June 30, 2021 allowance estimate considered
sustained reopening of the economy, further vaccine distribution and continued
increases in consumer spending on goods and services. Refer to the Economic
Environment in Regions' Banking Markets within the "Second Quarter Overview"
section for more information. Furthermore, Regions benchmarked its internal
forecast with external forecasts and external data available.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of June 30, 2021. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment remained normalized in the second quarter.

| 4,411  
  
The continued improvement in the economic forecast due to vaccine deployment,
the impact of expected charge-offs previously provided for, lower expectations
of future credit losses, and credit improvement (described above), were
significant drivers of the modeled decreases in the allowance.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The June 30, 2021 general imprecision
allowance was reduced compared to the first quarter of 2021, but continues to
reflect management's caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the
allowance given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery,
including the potential for higher inflation, as the changing status of the
pandemic unfolds.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$1.7 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of June 30, 2021.

`Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates,
unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, inflation and collateral
valuations as well as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
impact of the CARES Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future
levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit
metrics during the remainder of 2021 and beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. As provided initially in the CARES Act
passed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision of both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required
guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the
disclosures below.

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments
are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. Upon expiration of the
deferral period, customers may apply for additional relief or resume making
payments on their loans. Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on
the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower. The TDR relief and short-
term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded these modifications from
being classified as TDRs as of June 30, 2021.

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other
consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and
investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal
program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a
workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real
estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate
is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market.
Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information
is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan
balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the
periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but
not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed
loans excluded were $44 million at June 30, 2021 and $57 million at December
31, 2020.

Non-performing loans at June 30, 2021 have increased compared to year-end
levels, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial. The
decline in non-performing investor real estate loans is due to the
reclassification of a credit to held for sale as of June 30, 2021.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and
is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit),
at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more
often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting
unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2020 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and
the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit).

The result of the assessment performed for the second quarter of 2021 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for any of Regions' reporting units for
the June 30, 2021 interim period.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service
and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers.
Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality
banking services and the Company's digital channels and contact center.

The following table summarizes deposits by category:

Table 15--Deposits

Corporate treasury time deposits| 1 | | | 11 | | |  
| | | | |  
| $| 131,484 | | | $| 122,479 | | |  
  
Total deposits at June 30, 2021 increased approximately $9.0 billion compared
to year-end 2020 levels, driven by increases in categories other than customer
time deposits. Increases across categories were primarily driven by an
increase in customer deposit balances due to recent government stimulus
payments and new account growth. Also contributing to non-interest bearing
demand growth is an increase in deposits from business customers who continued
to retain excess liquidity. Customer time deposits decreased due to
maturities, and continued lower interest rates resulted in a decrease in the
utilization of time deposit accounts.

On January 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the
redemption on January 22, 2021, of its 3.20% senior notes due February 2021
pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of
100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On February 19, 2021, Regions Bank sent notices of redemption, which resulted
in the redemption on March 1, 2021 of its 2.75% senior bank notes due April 1,
2021 and of its senior floating rate bank notes due April 1, 2021 pursuant to
their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At June 30, 2021, one Ascentium note securitization class remained outstanding
with an interest rate of 2.12% maturing in October 2025. At December 31, 2020,
the Ascentium note securitizations had various classes and had a weighted-
average interest rate of 2.12% with remaining maturities ranging from 3 years
to 5 years and a weighted-average of 4.3 years.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $18.3 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $18.1
billion at December 31, 2020. During the first six months of 2021, net income
increased shareholders' equity by $1.4 billion, cash dividends on common stock
reduced shareholders' equity by $296 million, and cash dividends on preferred
stock reduced shareholders' equity by $57 million. Changes in AOCI decreased
shareholders' equity by $664 million, primarily due to the net change in
unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative
instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the six
months ended June 30, 2021. The derivative instruments are hedges designed to
protect net interest income in a low short-term interest rate environment,
such as the one that currently exists. During the second quarter of 2021, the
Company issued Series E preferred stock, which increased shareholders' equity
by $390 million. The Company also redeemed all of the outstanding shares of
it's Series A preferred stock, which decreased shareholders' equity by $500
million. Common stock repurchased during the first six months of 2021 reduced
shareholders' equity $167 million. These shares were immediately retired and
therefore are not included in treasury stock.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to
Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking
agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is
included in the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business"
section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory
Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2020
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13
"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated
financial statements in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At
June 30, 2021, the impact of the add-back on CET1 was approximately $432
million, or approximately 40 basis points.

_______

(1)The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,
and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

  

In October of 2020, the SCB framework that was finalized in the first quarter
of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk
sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help
determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5
percent to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result
of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital
Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5 percent in addition to the minimum
risk-weighted asset ratios shown above.

During the third quarter of 2020, and in connection with the results of its
supervisory stress test released in June 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized
Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third
quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the
amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario,
inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. In December
2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed the results of its supervisory stress test
associated with the capital plan resubmission. While the Federal Reserve did
not recalibrate SCBs as a part of the resubmission for participating banks,
Regions' implied SCB would have been floored at 2.5 percent based on capital
degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario had the SCB been
updated. The decision to update SCB requirements based on the resubmission
results was initially deferred to March 31 and subsequently deferred again to
June 30, 2021.

Regions chose to participate in 2021 CCAR in part to have the Federal Reserve
re-evaluate Regions' SCB. Regions received the results of the voluntary test
on June 28, 2021. The Federal Reserve communicated that the Company exceeded
all minimum capital levels under the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Stress
Test. Effective October 1, 2021, Regions' preliminary SCB requirement for the
fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at
2.5 percent.

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential
standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters
related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under
these rules.

  

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2020 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

On July 13, 2021, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, Fitch upgraded
Regions' outlook from Stable to Positive citing improved credit quality and
returns relative to peers.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more
information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall
classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average balances of loans", "adjusted ending
balances of loans", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted net
interest margin", "adjusted efficiency ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio",
"return on average tangible common shareholders' equity" on a consolidated
operations basis, and end of period "tangible common shareholders' equity",
and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain
other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a
meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes
will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and
predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used
by management to assess the performance of Regions' business because
management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be
indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these
non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of
the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and
the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Average total loans and ending total loans are presented including commercial
loans reclassified from held for sale and excluding loan balances related to
loans originated through the SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer
exit portfolio and the indirect-vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted
average total loans (non-GAAP) and adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP).
Regions believes adjusting average and ending total loans provides a
meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same
basis as that applied by management.

Table of Contents

  

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to
loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss
allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government, are excluded from total loans and the related credit loss is
excluded from the total allowance for credit losses.

Net interest margin is presented excluding the impact of SBA PPP loans and
excess cash, defined as cash exceeding $750 million. Regions believes the
adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) provides investors with meaningful
additional information about Regions' performance when margin associated with
the SBA's PPP loans and excess cash are excluded from net interest margin
(GAAP).

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are
added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted
efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common shareholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common shareholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common shareholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans
(GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of
ending total loans (GAAP) to adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), a
reconciliation of ACL (GAAP) to ACL excluding PPP loans' ACL (non-GAAP), and a
computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 4) a
reconciliation of net interest margin (GAAP) to adjusted net interest margin
(non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available
to common shareholders (GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest expense
(GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of net
interest income, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest
income, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of non-
interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 10) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 11) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), and 12) a reconciliation of average and ending
shareholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

(5)Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on
deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing
deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.06% and 0.23% for the six

Net interest income decreased slightly for the second quarter 2021 compared to
the same period in 2020 and increased slightly for the first six months of
2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Net interest income declines from
lower long-term rates have been offset by lower deposit and borrowing costs
and active cash management strategies, including $2 billion of securities
purchases in the second quarter of 2021. Interest income on loans for the
first three and six months of 2021 and 2020 was aided by the Company's hedging
strategy, with benefits expanding as more notional became active throughout
2020. The hedges had a positive impact of approximately $206 million for the
first six months of 2021 compared to $69 million in the same period of 2020.

The declines in net interest margin for the second quarter and first six
months of 2021, compared to the same periods in 2020, were primarily driven by
continued elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances. Regions
continues to prudently manage its excess liquidity balances through
extinguishments of long-term borrowings and securities purchases. Net interest
margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 was negatively
impacted by the repricing of fixed-rate loan portfolios and the securities
portfolio at lower market interest rates. Excluding the impact of PPP lending
and excess cash, which Regions considers to be balances in excess of $750
million, adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) for the second quarter 2021
and the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2020
declined modestly to 3.31% and 3.36%, respectively. While the second quarter
of 2021 securities purchases benefited net interest income and net interest
margin, they reduced adjusted net interest margin. See Table 19 "GAAP to Non-
GAAP Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of adjusted net interest margin.

Net interest income, exclusive of the impact from PPP loans and excess cash,
is expected to grow through the remainder of 2021; aided by hedging, balance
sheet management strategies, and deposit rates. Furthermore, long-term rate
pressure is expected to become more neutral near year-end.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all
rates fall to levels consistent with historical minimums. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of June 30, 2021, Regions was asset
sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as
compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending June
2022.

The second quarter of 2021 continued the trend of strong growth in low-cost
deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. Retention of these
balance sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and much of the recent deposit
growth may be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario. Therefore,
additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-related "surge" deposit
pricing behavior and retention is outlined in Table 21.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. Net interest income sensitivity to short-term
rates is approximately neutral when excluding pandemic-related deposit
increases. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the
Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1-month LIBOR)
will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such
rates higher or lower. Under either environment, it is expected that changes
in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the
change in asset yields. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge" deposits
with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for
further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario.

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors. While
this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it also
represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve
steepens. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as
intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will
drive yields higher on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans,
increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and
reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the
investment portfolio. The

78

opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest
rates fall. Approximately 70% of fixed rate asset production is at the 5-year
tenor point or shorter.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 21 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the
behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is
uncertain. Therefore, Table 21 includes two balance sheet scenarios to help
inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an opportunity scenario,
and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable, legacy balances,
which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second is a reduction
scenario assuming that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate,
requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the
bank. For this scenario, "surge" deposits are assumed to encompass all balance
growth on legacy accounts evidenced from February 2020 to June 2021, or
approximately $28 billion. These deposits, including non-interest bearing
products, are attributed with a 75% repricing beta in rising rate scenarios.
Importantly, the impact to net interest income under a changing rate
environment is the same whether the "surge" deposit balances are held at a
higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale
sources. Given the evolving nature of the environment, estimates have been
conservatively derived. Should the balances remain with the Company longer or
demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates, there is potential for upside
(e.g. the opportunity scenario). The disclosure in Table 21 does not prescribe
a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet.

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels
is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case
scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 21, interest-bearing deposit
rates move into the single digits. The deposit beta model is dynamic across
both interest rate level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100
basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate 20% to
25% interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the "surge"
deposit interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario, assuming
legacy betas and a 75% beta, respectively. Deposit pricing outperformance or
underperformance of 5% in that scenario would increase or decrease net
interest income by approximately $26 million, respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from
non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of
the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12
months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 21.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding
hedges is disclosed in Table 22 and its accompanying description. Importantly,
outstanding receive-fixed cash flow hedges begin to mature in December 2022.
While those maturities are outside of the 12-month horizon of the analysis
outlined in Table 21, the hedge maturity profile will begin to add asset
sensitivity at a time when markets currently expect the FOMC to begin to
increase short-term interest rates. Regions expects to maintain a persistent
amount of hedges through time to support a consistent, sustainable earnings
profile and will adjust outstanding derivatives depending on changing market
dynamics and the balance sheet mix.

(1)Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward
looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases
and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.

(2)All cash flow hedges are fully reflected within the measurement horizon
(See Table 23 for additional information regarding hedge maturity dates).

(3)Scenario assumes all deposits (including "surge" deposits) perform
consistently with historical experiences.

(4)Scenario accounts for uncertainty in "surge" deposit balances. Assumes a
75% beta on "surge" balances, calculated as legacy deposit growth experienced
since February 2020 ($28 billion as of June 2021).

(5)The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a rate shock where all
rates are floored at historical lows observed during the pandemic.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
equal to the historical all-time minimum. Further, the scenarios presented do
not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 21 above
quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under
this environment.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps
are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for
variable rate (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional
principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest
settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to
purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time.
Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market
instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign
currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a
specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf
of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another
party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives
to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its
mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the
origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the
potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect
the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in
interest rates and pricing.

(1)Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination
of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1-month LIBOR.

  

As of June 30, 2021, all of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in
Table 22 above were active. Total cash flow hedges have a current weighted
average maturity of approximately 3.1 years. During the first and second
quarters of 2021, Regions shortened a portion of its future hedge exposure to
balance its future interest rate risk needs with the evolving macro-economic
environment and its changing balance sheet. During the first and second
quarters of 2021, the Company terminated $2.0 billion and $250 million,
respectively, in notional of floor hedges. During the first and second
quarters of 2021, the Company terminated $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion,
respectively, in notional of swap hedges. Notional of $4.6 billion and $2.0
billion was replaced with shorter maturity swaps during the first and second
quarters of 2021, respectively. Longer maturity receive-fixed swap
terminations of $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 were intended to
offset some of the sensitivity impact from adding $2.0 billion fixed-rate
securities during the second quarter.

Importantly, the gain on unwound hedges is deferred and amortized into net
interest income over the life of the original hedge, creating no change in the
expected net interest income profile relative to the discounted future cash
flows under market forward rates at the time the hedges are unwound. These
changes and the resulting hedge maturity profile allow for an increasing asset
sensitive balance sheet position when the FOMC seems more likely to move
short-term rates higher. Further, the industry transition away from LIBOR
rates is not expected to materially impact either hedge effectiveness or
income recognition on the Company's current portfolio of hedges.

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts outstanding at
each year-end period. The initial hedge maturities begin in December 2022.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives
traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The

81

* * *

Table of Contents

  

counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing
broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk
mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit
Risk" section in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 contains more information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of
these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of
Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty
credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 8 "Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements
for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-end derivatives positions and
further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use
after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or
2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31, 2021.
Existing contracts referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated
no later than June 30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by
the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative
products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use
LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in
settings other than 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a
LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with
all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this
program, the Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks
associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks
associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR
Steering Committee. Regions is following industry efforts to develop
alternative reference rates and is operationally ready to offer new benchmarks
as they are adopted by regulatory agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

As of June 30, 2021, Regions had approximately $33.9 billion of total
outstanding commercial and investor real estate loans and $1.1 billion of
total consumer loans that reference LIBOR. Regions also has securities within
its investment portfolio of $420 million that reference LIBOR. Furthermore,
Regions' Series B and C preferred stock reference LIBOR when their dividend
rate begins to float after 2023 and had total carrying values of $433 million
and $490 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2021.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
sustains Regions' ability to meet the needs of the company and its customers.
Regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain liquidity sources and
reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions
maintains a variety of liquidity sources, as further described below.
Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses
and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available
liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.

82

* * *

Table of Contents

  

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity
base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans,
and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in
the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by
Regions' relatively steady deposit base.

The securities portfolio serves as a primary source and storehouse of
liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of
securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements).
Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the portfolio (for example, the
agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash
through various secured borrowing arrangements. Cash reserves, liquid assets
and secured borrowing capabilities (including borrowing capacity at the FHLB,
as discussed below) aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed
conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations
related to potential litigation. (See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.) Liquidity needs can also be met by
borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits
on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such
markets.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At June 30, 2021, Regions
had approximately $23.8 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase
from approximately $16.4 billion at December 31, 2020, which has continued to
be impacted by deposits associated with government programs offered in
relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for
more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of June 30, 2021, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $12.8 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of June 30, 2021, Regions had no
FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $15.2 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledges certain
securities and loans as collateral, which comprise its FHLB borrowing
capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required based on
membership and in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB
has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of
funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash
sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other
cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.1 billion at June 30, 2021.
Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk
Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO
regularly review compliance with the established limits.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber
attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, which have
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by
us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from
outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment
has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

83

* * *

Table of Contents

  

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer
transactions. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-
issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business
infrastructure components, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors
the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on
them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The benefit from credit losses totaled $337 million
in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a provision for credit losses of
$882 million during the second quarter of 2020. The benefit from credit losses
totaled $479 million for the first six months of 2021 compared to the
provision for credit losses of $1.3 billion for the first six months of 2020.
Refer to the "Allowance" section for further detail.

________

NM - Not Meaningful

  

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges. The increases during the second quarter and the first six
months of 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 were the result of
elevated consumer spending in 2021 as the economy began to reopen and the pace
of economic activity accelerated. While service charge revenue improved,
changes to customer spending behaviors as a result of the pandemic, combined
with enhancements to overdraft practices and transaction posting procedures,
are expected to keep service charges approximately ten to fifteen percent
below pre-pandemic levels. See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for
further detail.

Card and ATM fees--Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit
card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. Card and ATM
fees increased in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2021
compared to the same periods of 2020, driven by increased debit card spending
and transaction volume.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage
income in the

85

* * *

Table of Contents

  

second quarter compared to the same period in 2020 was due to compressed
margins on loans sold in the secondary market to maintain market
competitiveness. Additionally, mortgage refinance production was down in the
second quarter of 2021 compared to the elevated production volume experienced
in the same period in 2020. The decrease for the first six months of 2021
compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily a result of lower MSR market
valuation.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. Capital markets income decreased in the second
quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the
benefit of significant positive market-related credit valuation adjustments
within commercial swap income experienced in the second quarter of 2020. In
the first six months of 2021, capital markets income increased compared to the
same period in 2020 primarily driven by the exceptionally strong results in
the first quarter of 2021 and the relatively low capital markets income level
experienced by most categories in the first quarter of 2020.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance income primarily
represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of
insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned
life insurance increased during the second quarter and the first six months of
2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 due primarily to an $18 million
individual BOLI claim benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2021.

Investment services fee income--Investment services fee income represents
income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee
income increased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2021
compared to the same periods of 2020 due primarily to stronger financial
advisor production and favorable market conditions.

Commercial credit fee income--Commercial credit fee income includes letters of
credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Commercial credit fee
income increased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2021
compared to the same periods of 2020 driven primarily by an increase in unused
commercial line fees driven by continued low credit line utilization.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustment reported
as employee benefit assets - other is offset in salaries and benefits.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check
fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the second quarter
and the first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020
primarily due to increases in commercial loan and leasing related fee income
and SBIC income.

NM - Not Meaningful

  

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. During the first six months of 2021, salaries and benefits
expense increased compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by
higher 401(k) and other benefits expenses, as a result of positive market
valuation adjustments, and higher production-based incentives. Offsetting
these increases, full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 18,814 at June
30, 2021 from 20,073 at June 30, 2020, reflecting the continuing impact of the
Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic
priorities.

Equipment and software expense--Equipment and software expense includes
depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of
equipment and software (software is rented and internally developed) utilized
by Regions and its affiliates. Equipment and software expense increased in the
first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, driven primarily
by software rental expense, depreciation, and maintenance and repair.

Outside services--Outside services consists of expenses related to routine
services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs,
data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data
subscriptions, and check

printing. Outside services decreased during the second quarter and the first
six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due primarily to
Regions exiting a third party lending relationship.

Marketing--Marketing consists of advertising, market research, and public
relations expenses. Marketing increased during the second quarter and the
first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to the
timing of marketing campaigns.

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses--Professional, legal and
regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other
professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory
expenses decreased during the second quarter compared to the same period in
2020, primarily due to lower legal expenses.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt--During the second quarter of 2020,
Regions executed the partial debt extinguishment of two senior bank notes and
early terminations of FHLB advances, incurring related early extinguishment
pre-tax charges totaling $6 million.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses
and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was
$231 million compared to income tax benefit of $47 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 22.6 percent
and 18.3 percent, respectively. The income tax expense for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 was $411 million compared to income tax benefit of $5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, resulting in effective tax
rates of 22.3 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. The Company expects the
full-year tax rate to be approximately 22 percent to 23 percent for 2021,
excluding the impact of unanticipated discrete items.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance,
tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax
rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not
consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged
leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to
unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax
rate between periods may be impacted.

At June 30, 2021, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $451
million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $505 million at December
31, 2020. The decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily due to
the decrease in unrealized gains on available for sale securities and
derivative instruments, which was partially offset by a decrease in the
deferred tax asset related to allowance for loan losses.

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance
company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to
increase business loans and leases to small business customers using
Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities.

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of
assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired,
$1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial
and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were
long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of
the borrowings, and as of June 30, 2021, $39 million of long-term debt
remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair value.

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on
the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered
to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price
less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is
recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition,
which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related
to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset
value as part of the acquisition.

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value
mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the
contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The
amortization will not be material.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of
$348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. Purchase accounting
adjustments of $16 million reduced goodwill during the measurement period.
Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other
intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life
of each recognized asset.

Item 3\. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Reference is made to pages 81 through 85 included in Management's Discussion
and Analysis.

Item 4\. Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,
under the supervision and with the participation of Regions' management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Regions'
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. During the quarter ended June
30, 2021, there have been no changes in Regions' internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial reporting.

(1)Included in the share repurchases are approximately 1 million shares that
were repurchased as part of the amendment to the Company's deferred investment
plan for its directors.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, Regions announced
the Board's authorization of the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the
Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2021
through the first quarter of 2022. All of these shares were immediately
retired upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury
stock.
