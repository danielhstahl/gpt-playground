Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical
information, but rather are related to future operations, strategies,
financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based
on management's current expectations as well as certain assumptions and
estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the
statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are
subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are
likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections
expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any
of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other
factors include, but are not limited to, those described below:

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above decreased from 1,379 at December 31, 2018 to 1,172 at March 31,
2019. The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2018 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented an
OTTI as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not
more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions
before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating OTTI, management did
identify a limited number of positions where an OTTI was believed to exist as
of March 31, 2019.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, Regions purchased
approximately $171 million and $70 million in indirect-other consumer loans
from third parties, respectively.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, Regions sold $167 million of
affordable housing residential mortgage loans.

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending
business due to competition-based margin compression impacting overall returns
on the portfolio. Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the
first quarter of 2019 and intends to complete any in-process indirect auto
loan closings by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will
remain in the direct auto lending business.

At March 31, 2019, $21.9 billion in securities and net eligible loans held by
Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the FHLB.
At March 31, 2019, an additional $25.9 billion in net eligible loans held by
Regions were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2018, for a description of the methodology.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by
portfolio segment for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The
total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances
are disaggregated to detail the amounts derived through individual evaluation
and collective evaluation for impairment. The allowance for loan losses
related to individually evaluated loans is attributable to reserves for non-
accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs. The allowance
for loan losses and the loan portfolio ending balances related to collectively
evaluated loans is attributable to the remainder of the portfolio.

Commercial--The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and
industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations
to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion
projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness
of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers' business
operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in commodity prices.

Investor Real Estate--Loans for real estate development are repaid through
cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This
portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or
investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income
generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real
estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product
types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions' markets.
Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such
as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping
centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the
valuation of real estate.

Consumer--The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage,
home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card,
and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to
consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15
to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their
primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and
lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second
mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the
equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or
line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in
addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses.
Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale
lending through third parties. Consumer credit card lending includes Regions
branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer loans include other
revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in
this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer
economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The following tables present credit quality indicators for portfolio segments
and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of March 31, 2019, and December
31, 2018. Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are detailed
by categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default.
Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the
relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis
or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the
borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories
are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Pass--includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Special Mention--includes obligations that have potential weakness that may,
if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the
Company's position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also
be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an
adverse effect on debt service ability;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Substandard Accrual--includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness
that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently
performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility
that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not
corrected;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Non-accrual--includes obligations where management has determined that full
payment of principal and interest is in doubt.  
  
Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to
as "classified." Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans
are often collectively referred to as "criticized and classified." Classes in
the consumer portfolio segment are disaggregated by accrual status.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 6 "Allowance For Credit Losses" in the 2018 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's TDRs.

Further discussion related to TDRs, including their impact on the allowance
for loan losses and designation of TDRs in periods subsequent to the
modification is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs. Loans first reported as
TDRs during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled
approximately $85 million and $171 million, respectively.

TDRs that defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and
that were modified in the previous twelve months (i.e., the twelve months
prior to default) were immaterial. At March 31, 2019, approximately $18
million of commercial and investor real estate loans modified as TDRs during
the three months ended March 31, 2019 were on non-accrual status.

At March 31, 2019, Regions had restructured binding unfunded commitments
totaling $7 million where a concession was granted and the borrower was in
financial difficulty.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

________

(1) "Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns.

  

On March 27, 2019, the Company sold $167 million of affordable housing
residential mortgage loans and as part of the transaction kept the rights to
service the loans, which resulted in a retained residential MSR of
approximately $2 million.

  

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one

factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or
counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by
Regions would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in
the table above.

The following table presents servicing related fees, which include
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income
resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans:

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 12 for additional information related to the guarantee.

As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the DUS servicing portfolio was
approximately $3.6 billion. The related commercial MSRs were approximately $55
million and $56 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The estimated fair value of the loss share guarantee was approximately $4
million at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

NOTE 5. LEASES

LESSEE

Regions' lease portfolio is primarily composed of property leases that are
classified as either operating or finance leases with the majority classified
as operating leases. Property leases, which primarily include office locations
and retail branches, typically have original lease terms ranging from 1 year
to 20 years, some of which may also include an option to extend the lease
beyond the original lease term. In some circumstances, Regions may also have
an option to terminate the lease early with advance notice. Regions includes
renewal and termination options within the lease term if deemed reasonably
certain of exercise. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions
utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the
lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet,
and Regions continues to recognize lease payments as an expense over the lease
term as appropriate. The remainder of the lease portfolio is comprised of
equipment leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 3 years.

As of March 31, 2019, assets and liabilities recorded under operating leases
for properties is $430 million and $511 million, respectively. The difference
between the asset and liability balance is largely the result of lease
liabilities that existed prior to the January 1, 2019 adoption of the new
accounting guidance for leases. The asset is recorded within other assets and
the lease liability is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet.

Lease expense is comprised of the following:

LESSOR

Regions engages in both direct financing and sales-type leasing. Regions also
has portfolios of leveraged and operating leases. These arrangements provide
equipment financing for leased assets, such as vehicles and aircraft. At the
commencement date, Regions (lessor) enters into an agreement with the customer
(lessee) to lease the underlying equipment for a specified lease term. The
lease agreements may provide customers the option to terminate the lease by
buying the equipment at fair market value at the time of termination or at the
end of the lease term. Regions' equipment finance asset management group
performs due diligence procedures on the lease residual and overall equipment
values as part of the origination process. Regions performs lease residual
value reviews on an ongoing basis.. In order to manage the residual value risk
inherent in some of its direct financing leases, Regions purchases residual
value insurance from an independent third party. The sales-type, direct
financing and leveraged leases are recorded within loans on the consolidated
balance sheet and operating leases are recorded within other earning assets on
the consolidated balance sheet.

The following table presents a summary of Regions' sales-type, direct
financing, operating, and leveraged leases:

(1) Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR
plus 3.536%.

For each preferred stock issuance listed above, Regions issued depositary
shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the
Company's preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per
share of preferred stock (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share).
Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are payable
quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and
redemption is solely at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in
whole, or in part, after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in
part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event for the
Series A preferred stock or at any time following a regulatory capital
treatment event for the Series B preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared $8 million in cash dividends on both Series A
and Series B Preferred Stock during the first three months of 2019 and 2018.

In the event Series A and Series B preferred shares are redeemed at the
liquidation amounts, $113 million and $67 million excess of the redemption
amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively.
Approximately $100 million of Series

A preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock,
including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained
earnings, and approximately $13 million of related issuance costs that were
recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be
recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders.
Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded
as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately $15 million of related
issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to
common shareholders.

On April 30, 2019, Regions completed the issuance of $500 million in
depositary shares each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of
the Company's 5.7% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock, Series C, par value $1.00 per share ("Series C Preferred Stock"), with
a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock
(equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share). Dividends will be paid quarterly
at an annual rate equal to (i) for each period beginning prior to August 15,
2029, 5.7%, and (ii) for each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029,
three-month LIBOR plus 3.148%.

COMMON STOCK

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.
As part of the Company's capital plan, the Board authorized a $2.031 billion
common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the
third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019. This plan is
inclusive of the capital generated from the sale of Regions Insurance Group,
Inc. and related affiliates during the third quarter of 2018 (see Note 3
"Discontinued Operations" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018 for more information). The capital plan included a proposed
increase of the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14 per common share that
began in the third quarter of 2018.

Regions declared a $0.14 per share cash dividend on the common stock for the
first quarter of 2019 as compared to $0.09 per common share for the first
quarter of 2018.

As of March 31, 2019, Regions has repurchased 102.6 million shares of common
stock under the 2018 capital plan at a total cost of approximately $1.8
billion. The Company also continued open market share repurchases under its
capital plan in the second quarter of 2019. As of May 7, 2019, Regions had
repurchased approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost
of approximately $74.5 million. All of these shares were immediately retired
upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury stock.

In a period where there is a loss from discontinued operations, basic
weighted-average common shares outstanding are used to determine both basic
and diluted earnings per share.  
  
  

The effects from the assumed exercise of 5 million and 6 million stock
options, restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units for the
three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in
the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such
amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (credit) is recorded
in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

Regions' funding policy for the qualified plans is to contribute annually at
least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made no
contributions during the first three months of 2019.

Regions also provides other postretirement benefits, such as defined benefit
health care plans and life insurance plans, that cover certain retired
employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on
the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2019 or 2018.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors.

Regions recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of $47 million and $136
million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively, related to discontinued cash flow hedges of loan
instruments, which will be amortized into earnings in conjunction with the
recognition of interest payments through 2025. Regions recognized pre-tax
income

Table of Contents

  

  

of $5 million and $15 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow
hedges of loan instruments.

Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $31 million in pre-
tax expense due to the receipt or payment of interest payments on all cash
flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is $9
million in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of discontinued cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which Regions is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
is approximately seven years as of March 31, 2019, and a portion of these
hedges are forward starting.

The following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on
the consolidated statements of income and the total amounts for the respective
line items effected:

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income and other) and included in other assets and other
liabilities, as appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Regions had $320 million and $191
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018,
Regions had $539 million and $429 million, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage
income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and
corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans
are included in capital markets fee income and other.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Concurrent with
the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using
various derivative instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments,
futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in
the fair value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of
income. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount
related to these contracts was $4.0 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss)
recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in
the consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31,
2019 and 2018:

Credit risk, defined as all positive exposures not collateralized with cash or
other assets or reserved for, at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, totaled
approximately $178 million and $130 million, respectively. These amounts
represent the net credit risk on all trading and other derivative positions
held by Regions.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2019 and 2026.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2019 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of March 31, 2019 was approximately $563 million. This scenario would only
occur if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties
defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at March 31,
2019 and 2018 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit
protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap
transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, were $50 million and $45 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $49 million and $43
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis as of March 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018:

All following disclosures related to Level 3 recurring and non-recurring
assets do not include those deemed to be immaterial.  
  
Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables present detailed information regarding material assets
and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as of March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The tables include the
valuation techniques and the significant unobservable inputs utilized. The
range of each significant unobservable input as well as the weighted-average
within the range utilized at March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, are
included. Following the tables are descriptions of the valuation techniques

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4. See Note 4 for these amounts
and additional disclosures related to assumptions used in the fair value
calculation for MSRs.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all FNMA and FHLMC eligible
residential mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated
with the intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of
the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. These changes in fair
value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion
of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit
risk.

Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. In
the current whole loan market, financial investors are generally requiring a
higher rate of return than the return inherent in loans if held to maturity.
The fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at March
31, 2019 was $771 million or 0.9 percent.

NOTE 11. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. Additional
information about the Company's reportable segments is included in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised.

Discontinued operations includes all brokerage and investment activities
associated with the sale of Morgan Keegan which closed on April 2, 2012, as
well as the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates,
which closed on July 2, 2018. See Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" to the
consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2018 for further discussion.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

Unused commitments to extend credit--To accommodate the financial needs of its

consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among
others) credit

card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-
term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan commitments have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a
fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being
funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
liquidity requirements.

Standby letters of credit--Standby letters of credit are also issued to
customers, which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if
certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the
customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby
letter of credit. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of
credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters
of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions
could be required to make and represents Regions' maximum credit risk.

Commercial letters of credit--Commercial letters of credit are issued to
facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general
rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in
transit.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

In addition, Regions has agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal
matters resulting from pre-closing activities in conjunction with the sale of
Morgan Keegan and recorded an indemnification obligation at fair value in the
second quarter of 2012.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
March 31, 2019, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably
possible estimate includes legal contingencies that are subject to the
indemnification agreement with Raymond James.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not
complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. Additional inquiries will
arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The
inquiries, including the one described below, could develop into
administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that
could result in consequences that have a material effect on Regions'
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a
whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments, findings,
settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the United States Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York pertaining to Regions' banking
relationship with a former customer and accounts maintained by related
entities and individuals affiliated with the customer who may be involved in
criminal activity, as well as related aspects of Regions' Anti-Money
Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on

  

44

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected future
developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any of the
matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any particular
reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

As discussed in Note 3 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018, on April 2, 2012 ("Closing Date"), Regions closed the sale
of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection with
the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters
related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the
Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses
under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for
judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution
of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments
that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is
indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. As of
March 31, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the indemnification
obligation were immaterial.

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018,
the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $3.6 billion.
Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to its loss share
guarantee was approximately $1.2 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December
31, 2018. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans
it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss,
were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was
determined to be without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the
maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual
loss the Company would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the
associated loss share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's
consolidated balance sheets was approximately $4 million at both March 31,
2019 and December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional information.

NOTE 13. REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services
is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or
services. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2018, for descriptions of the accounting and reporting
policies related to revenue recognition.

This revenue is not impacted by the accounting guidance related to revenue
from contracts with customers and continues to be recognized when earned in
accordance with the Company's existing revenue recognition policy.  
  
Regions elected the practical expedient related to contract costs and will
continue to expense sales commissions and any related contract costs when
incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.

Regions also elected the practical expedient related to remaining performance
obligations and therefore did not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations for 1) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less and 2) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the
amount to which Regions has the right to invoice for services performed.

This ASU creates ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The
new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding liability equal to the present value of future rental payments
on their balance sheets for all leases with a term greater than one year.
There are not significant changes to lessor accounting; however, there were
certain improvements made to align lessor accounting with the lessee
accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This
guidance expands both quantitative and qualitative required disclosures.

|

January 1, 2019

|

Regions adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition
method, which allowed for a modified retrospective method of adoption with an
immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings without restating
comparable periods. Regions elected the relief package of practical expedients
for which there is no requirement to reassess existence of leases, their
classification, and initial direct costs. Regions also applied the exemption
for short-term leases with a term of less than one year, whereby Regions does
not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet but
instead recognizes lease payments as an expense over the lease term as
appropriate. For property leases, Regions did not elect the practical
expedient to combine lease and non-lease components.

  

The standard resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities for operating leases, while accounting for finance leases remains
largely unchanged. Adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of
additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of
approximately $451 million as of January 1, 2019.

  

Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions utilizes the
incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement
date to determine the present value of the lease payments. Lease terms may
include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain
that the option will be exercised. Lease expenses are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.  
  
ASU 2017-08, Receivables- Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

|

This ASU amends Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other
Costs, to shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt
securities held at a premium to the earliest call date. Current guidance
generally requires entities to amortize a premium as a yield adjustment over
the contractual life of the instrument. Shortening the amortization period is
generally expected to more closely align the recognition of interest income
with expectations incorporated into the pricing of the underlying securities.
The amendments do not affect the accounting treatment of discounts. This ASU
should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

ASU 2018-07,  
Compensation - Stock Compensation  

|

This ASU amends and expands the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services for non-employees. Under this guidance, the accounting for share-
based payments to non-employees and employees will be substantially aligned.
The measurement of equity-classified non-employee awards will now be fixed at
the grant date.

ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements  

|

The FASB issued this ASU to clarify, improve, and correct errors in the
Codification. The ASU covers nine amendments, which affect a wide variety of
Topics including business combinations, debt, derivatives and hedging, and
defined contribution pension plans. Some amendments do not require transition
guidance and are effective upon issuance, while others will be applicable for
Regions starting in 2019. However, all amendments are expected to have an
immaterial impact to Regions.

ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging  

|

This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to expand the list of U.S.
benchmark interest rates permitted in applying hedge accounting. The
amendments permit all entities that elect to apply hedge accounting to
benchmark interest rate hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to use
the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate in addition
to the four eligible U.S. benchmark interest rates. The amendments should be
applied prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships
entered into on or after the date of adoption.

ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

  

ASU 2018-19 Codification Improvements to Topic 326

|

This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses to replace the
current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss
approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other
commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all
available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect
the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to
collect. The amendments also eliminate the current accounting model for
purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Additional quantitative
and qualitative disclosures are required upon adoption.  
  
While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the
ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit
losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized
cost of the securities by direct write-offs.  
  
The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Entities that
have loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should
prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit
deteriorated assets.

|

January 1, 2020

|

Regions' cross-functional implementation team, which is co-led by Finance and
Risk Management, has developed a project plan that results in running a CECL
parallel production during 2019 and the adoption of the standard in the first
quarter of 2020. Key project implementation activities for 2019 include
finalization of models, the qualitative framework, and the production process;
completion of documentation, policies and disclosures; development of
supporting analytics; and process and control testing.

  

The project implementation plan also establishes a parallel processing
timeline which began with a limited parallel run in the first quarter of 2019.
The first quarter 2019 limited parallel run included running, validating and
reconciling all models. However, the qualitative framework and certain
internal controls have not been fully developed and therefore were not
included in the first quarter parallel run. Parallel runs will be enhanced
throughout the year to include the qualitative framework, supporting
analytics, end-to-end governance, internal controls and disclosures.

Regions provides updates to senior management and to the Audit Committee and
Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These communications provide an
update on the status of the implementation as discussed above.

Adoption of the standard may result in an overall material increase in the
allowance for credit losses given the change from accounting for losses
inherent in the loan portfolio to accounting for losses over the remaining
contractual life of the portfolio. However, the impact at adoption will be
influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as
well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. Based on initial
modeling, the consumer loan portfolios are expected to experience an increase
due to longer-dated loans in products such as residential first mortgages and
home equity lending products. Additionally, there could be increases or
decreases in the allowance in certain other loan portfolios at adoption.

Regions expects no material allowance on held to maturity securities because
most of this portfolio consists of agency-backed securities that inherently
have an immaterial risk of loss. Additionally, Regions expects no material
impact to available for sale securities.

other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is hosted
by the vendor, i.e. a service contract. Customers will apply the same criteria
for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that
has a software license. The amendments also prescribe the balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized
implementation costs and related amortization expense, and require additional
quantitative and qualitative disclosures.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2018, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in the Form 10-K. See Note 1 "Basis of
Presentation" and Note 14 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the
consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of this
discussion will be on the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2018 for the consolidated statements of income.
For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion will be
the balances as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 5 through 7 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At March 31, 2019, Regions operated 1,456 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and
Other. See Note 11 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated
financial statements for more information regarding Regions' segment reporting
structure.

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. The gain associated
with the transaction amounted to $281 million gain ($196 million after tax).
On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on
April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not
included in the sale; they are included in the Wealth Management segment. See
Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for
further discussion.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and
other financing income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest
income and other financing income is primarily the difference between the
interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and
securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing
liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions' net interest income
and other financing income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance
sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its
assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Net interest income and other
financing income also includes rental income and depreciation expense
associated with operating leases for which Regions is the lessor. Non-interest
income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM
fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and
trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions
provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan
losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits,
occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance
assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a
competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service
and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient
locations.

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $378 million,
or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $398
million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018. The primary
driver of the decrease in net income from the prior year period was the
increase in the provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net
interest income and other financing income and lower non-interest expense.

Table of Contents

  

  

For the first quarter of 2019, net interest income and other financing income
(taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $961 million million, up $39 million
compared to the first quarter of 2018. The net interest margin (taxable-
equivalent basis) was 3.53 percent for the first quarter of 2019 and 3.46
percent in the first quarter of 2018. Net interest margin and net interest
income and other financing income benefited primarily from higher interest
rates partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income and other
financing income also benefited from higher average loan balances.

The provision (credit) for loan losses totaled $91 million in the first
quarter of 2019 compared to $(10) million during the first quarter of 2018.
Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion
and Analysis for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $78 million, or an annualized 0.38 percent of average
loans, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $84 million, or an annualized
0.42 percent for the first quarter of 2018. See Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

The allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, was
1.01 percent of total loans, net of unearned income. Total non-performing
loans increased to 0.62 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at
March 31, 2019, compared to 0.60 percent at December 31, 2018.

Non-interest income from continuing operations was $502 million for the first
quarter of 2019 compared to $507 million for the first quarter of 2018. The
decrease was primarily driven by declines in capital markets income and
mortgage income, combined with net securities losses partially offset by
increases in service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, and bank-
owned life insurance. See Table 20 "Non-Interest Income from Continuing
Operations" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense from continuing operations was $860 million in the
first quarter of 2019, a $24 million decrease from the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower salaries and employee benefits
expense, FDIC insurance assessments and professional fees partially offset by
an increase in other non-interest expense. See Table 21 "Non-Interest Expense
from Continuing Operations" for more detail.

Income tax expense from continuing operations for the three months ended March
31, 2019 was $105 million compared to $128 million for the same period in
2018. See "Income Taxes" toward the end of the Management's Discussion and
Analysis section of this report for more detail.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $269 million from year-end
2018 to March 31, 2019, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with
the FRB, as the result of normal day-to-day operating variations.

Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of
agency mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. See the
"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity Risk" sections for more
information.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $318 million at March 31, 2019, consisting of $288
million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $17 million of commercial
mortgage and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. At December
31, 2018, loans held for sale totaled $304 million, consisting of $256 million
of residential real estate mortgage loans, $38 million of commercial mortgage
and other loans, and $10 million of non-performing loans. The levels of
residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are
part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on
the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 74 percent of
Regions' interest-earning assets at March 31, 2019. The following table
presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and
class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2018 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional discussion.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $1.7 billion since year-end 2018 driven
primarily by an increase in line utilization, the expansion of existing
customer relationships and addition of new relationships. The Company
experienced increases in the corporate, middle market and real estate
portfolios aided by growth within specialized lending groups, diversified
lending groups and real estate investment trust portfolios. Commercial also
includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating
businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and
are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations. These loans
declined $27 million from year-end 2018, reflecting a slowing pace of decline.
Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to
commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $150 million in comparison to 2018 year-
end balances. Due to the nature of the cash flows typically used to repay
investor real estate loans, these loans are particularly vulnerable to weak
economic conditions.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans decreased $163 million in comparison to 2018 year-end balances
primarily due to the first quarter 2019 sale of $167 million of affordable
housing residential mortgage loans, which generated an $8 million pre-tax
gain. Approximately $469 million in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the first three months of 2019.

Home Equity

Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This
type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their
homes. The home equity portfolio totaled $9.0 billion at March 31, 2019 as
compared to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Substantially all of this
portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March
31, 2019. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period.

Of the $9.0 billion home equity portfolio at March 31, 2019, approximately
$5.7 billion were home equity lines of credit and $3.3 billion were closed-end
home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Beginning in
December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and
a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have
an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009
to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a
10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a
20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw
period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means
there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for
interest-only lines of credit.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio
segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due
to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the
entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance
exceeds

the current estimated collateral, the entire balance is included in the "Above
100%" category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially
offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $294 million from year-end 2018.
The decrease is due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the
fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue
its indirect auto lending business due to competition-based margin compression
impacting overall returns on the portfolio. Regions ceased originating new
indirect auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and intends to complete any
in-process indirect auto loan closings by the end of the second quarter of
2019. The Company will remain in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale lending through
third parties. This portfolio class increased $198 million from year-end 2018,
primarily due to continued growth in existing point of sale initiatives.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $71 million from
year-end 2018 reflecting seasonality.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $25 million from year-
end 2018.

Regions qualitatively considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators
for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. The
following tables present estimated current FICO score data for components of
classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current FICO data is not available
for the remaining loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if
customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available.
Residential first mortgage and home equity balances with FICO scores below 620
were 5 percent of the combined portfolios for both March 31, 2019 and December
31, 2018.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.
Discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance is included in
Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for
Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as related
discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $853 million at March 31, 2019 as
compared to $840 million at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses
as a percentage of net loans was 1.01% at both March 31, 2019 and December 31,
2018.

The provision (credit) for loan losses increased by $101 million for the first
quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. During the first
quarter of 2018, lower than anticipated losses associated with certain 2017
hurricanes resulted in a reduction of $30 million to the Company's hurricane-
specific loan loss allowance, and the sale of $254 million in residential
first mortgage loans consisting primarily of performing troubled debt
restructured loans resulted in a $16 million net reduction to the provision
for loan losses. Both of these factors, combined with broad-based improved
credit metrics, resulted in the credit for loan losses for the first quarter
of 2018. Higher loan balances and the stabilization and normalization of
credit resulted in the increased provision for loan losses for the first
quarter of 2019. The provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2019
was approximately $13 million greater than net charge-offs, which included
provision for loan growth. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2019 were
approximately $6 million lower compared to the same period in 2018.

Management expects that net loan charge-offs will be in the 0.40 percent to
0.50 percent range for the 2019 year based on recent trends and current market
conditions. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility
in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future levels of
net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during
the remainder of 2019. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to
individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 7 "Allowance
for Credit Losses."

Refer to Note 14 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the consolidated
financial statements for discussion regarding the pending accounting
pronouncement that will replace the current incurred loss accounting model for
the allowance for credit losses with a current expected credit loss approach
(CECL), which will be effective for Regions on January 1, 2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity,
consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under
the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the
result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were
offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and
investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in
interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below
market. More detailed information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance For Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The
following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing
and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

Note: All loans listed in the table above are considered impaired under
applicable accounting literature.

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR inflows in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to inflows from
CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types
of concessions currently being granted under the CAP, as detailed in Note 3
"Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

loans transferred to held for sale. It also includes less than $1 million of
both commercial loans and investor real estate loans refinanced or
restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification for the three
months ended March 31, 2019. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, $8
million of commercial loans and $5 million of investor real estate loans were
refinanced or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification.

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA

excluded were $76 million at March 31, 2019 and $84 million at December 31,
2018.  
  
Non-performing loans at March 31, 2019 have increased compared to year-end
levels as asset quality continued to normalize. Total commercial and investor
real estate non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, that were
paying as agreed (e.g., less than 30 days past due) represented approximately
60 percent of the total balance at March 31, 2019.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, excluding government
guaranteed loans, were $147 million at March 31, 2019, an increase from $143
million at December 31, 2018.

Table of Contents

  

  

At March 31, 2019, Regions had approximately $75 million to $135 million of
potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not
included in non-accrual loans, but for which management had concerns as to the
ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms.
This is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate
loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next
quarter.

In order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans, credit
personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be
downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending on the occurrence of
future events. These personnel consider a variety of factors, including the
borrower's capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms,
make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary,
and provide current and complete financial information including global cash
flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. Based upon the
consideration of these factors, a probability weighting is assigned to loans
to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans
during this specific time period. Additionally, for other loans (for example,
smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the
estimate of potential future downgrades. Because of the inherent uncertainty
in forecasting future events, the estimate of potential problem loans
ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as
opposed to an individual listing of loans.

The majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is
based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for
substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are
included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements.

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans
held for sale) by portfolio segment:

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and
is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit),
at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more
often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting
unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2018 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and
the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit).

The result of the assessment performed for the first quarter of 2019 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions' reporting units for
the March 31, 2019 interim period.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions
also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking
services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet
banking.

Total deposits at March 31, 2019 increased approximately $1.2 billion compared
to year-end 2018 levels, with the deposit mix experiencing movement from lower
cost to higher cost products. During the first quarter of 2019, balance
increases in interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings, customer time
deposits, and brokered treasury time deposits were partially offset by balance
decreases in non-interest-bearing demand and money market accounts.
Specifically, interest-bearing transaction and time deposit balances increased
due to the offering of higher rates, portfolio remixing, and overall account
growth. Savings account balances increased, generally reflecting seasonal
trends. The non-interest-bearing demand decline was due primarily to customers
using liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses, as well as
portfolio remixing. The decrease in money market account balances reflects the
final portion of a longer-term initiative to reduce higher-cost retail
brokered sweep deposits. Treasury brokered time deposits were used to
supplement incremental balance sheet funding needs.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, totaled $1.6 billion at
both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The levels of these borrowings can
fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized.

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions' funding strategy.

The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances
continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity
Risk" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings increased by approximately $533 million since year-end
2018 due primarily to a $500 million issuance of senior notes through a
reopening of the Company's 3.80% senior notes due August 2023, which were
effectively converted to floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR through the
simultaneous execution of an interest rate swap.

Long-term FHLB advances have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.6 percent
at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 with remaining maturities ranging
from less than one year to nine years and a weighted-average of approximately
1 year.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stockholders' equity was $15.5 billion at March 31, 2019 as compared to $15.1
billion at December 31, 2018. During the first three months of 2019, net
income increased stockholders' equity by $394 million, while cash dividends on
common stock reduced stockholders' equity by $142 million and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced stockholder's equity by $16 million. Changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by $366
million, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on
securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of
changes in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2019. Common
stock repurchased during the first three months of 2019 reduced stockholders'
equity by $190 million. These shares were immediately retired and therefore
are not included in treasury stock.

Total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $11 million, representing the
unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which
Regions held the majority interest at March 31, 2019.

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.

See Note 6 "Stockholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CAPITAL RULES

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to
Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking
agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is
included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion
and Analysis in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is
also included in Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to
the consolidated financial statements in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

regulatory requirements:

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO

Regions is currently subject to the Basel III-based U.S. LCR rule, which is a
quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC
maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets under
an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Following the threshold amendments
recently made by EGRRCPA, the LCR rule currently applies in a modified, less
stringent, form to BHCs, such as Regions, having $100 billion or more but less
than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in
total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. However, on October 31, 2018, the
Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC proposed rules that would, among other
things, make institutions such as Regions with less than $250 billion in total
consolidated assets no longer subject to the LCR requirement. The LCR rule
also imposes a monthly calculation requirement. In December 2016, the Federal
Reserve issued a final rule on the public disclosure of the LCR calculation
that requires BHCs, such as Regions, to disclose publicly, on a quarterly
basis, quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of
its LCR beginning with results from the fourth quarter of 2018.

At March 31, 2019, the Company was fully compliant with the LCR requirements.
Changes in the mix and size of the Company's balance sheet and investment
portfolio are likely to occur in the future, and additional funding may need
to be sourced to remain compliant.

See the "Supervision and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the
"Business" section and the "Risk Factors" section in the 2018 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for more information.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2018 for more information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average total loans," "adjusted efficiency ratio,"
"adjusted fee income ratio," "return on average tangible common stockholders'
equity," on a consolidated and continuing operations basis, and end of period
"tangible common stockholders' equity," and "Basel III CET1, on a fully
phased-in basis" and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings
and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items
provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management
believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the
Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures
are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions' business
because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments
to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of
these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the
performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.
Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

Presentations to investors of Company performance  
  
Total average loans is presented including (1) the impact of the fourth
quarter of 2018 reclassification of purchase cards to commercial and
industrial loans from others assets, (2) excluding the impact of the first
quarter 2018 residential first mortgage loan sale, and (3) excluding the
indirect vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans
(non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a meaning
calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that
applied by management.

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these

  

66

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and
non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a
taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total
revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for
the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common stockholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common stockholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common stockholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

The calculation of the fully phased-in pro-forma "Common equity Tier 1" (CET1)
is based on Regions' understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For
Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased-in approach
starting in 2015 with full implementation extending to 2019. The Basel III
rules are now fully phased in, other than with respect to deductions and
adjustments whose transitional treatment has been extended until the federal
banking agencies' September 2017 proposal to revise and simplify the capital
treatment of selected categories of assets is finalized. The calculation
provided in the following table includes estimated pro-forma amounts for the
ratio on a fully phased-in basis. Regions' current understanding of the final
framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company's interpretation
of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory
process. Regions' understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely
change as analyses and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions
is not currently subject to the fully phased-in capital rules, this pro-forma
measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and other entities
may calculate it differently from Regions' disclosed calculation. Since
analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy using the
fully phased-in Basel III framework, Regions believes that it is useful to
provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this same
basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans to
adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of net income
(GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of non-interest expense from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest expense from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 4) a
reconciliation of non-interest income from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 5) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 6) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of average and ending
stockholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
stockholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP),
9) a reconciliation of stockholders' equity (GAAP) to Basel III CET1, on a
fully phased-in basis (non-GAAP), and 10) calculation of the related ratio
based on Regions' current understanding of the Basel III requirements (non-
GAAP).

For the first quarter of 2019, net interest income and other financing income
(taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $961 million compared to $922 million in
the first quarter of 2018. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis)
was 3.53 percent for the first quarter of 2019 and 3.46 percent for the first
quarter of 2018. The increase in net interest margin (taxable-equivalent
basis) for the first quarter of 2019, compared to the same period of 2018, was
primarily due to higher market interest rates and higher yields on earning
assets, particularly loans, exceeding the increase in total funding costs.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income and other financing income in various interest rate scenarios compared
to a base case scenario. Net interest income and other financing income
sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of
Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income and other financing
income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate
cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions
are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of
the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that
results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the
assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the
pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the
characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly
considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts,
prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well
as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income and other financing income
throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate
sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest
rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using "market
forward rates." The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the
traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis
points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company continues
to present the minus 100 basis point shock. Rising and falling rate scenarios
of greater magnitude are also analyzed. While not presented in Table 18, the
impact of a larger magnitude down rate scenario based on historical yield
curve minimums is explained in the following section. In addition to parallel
curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of March 31, 2019, Regions was asset
sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as
compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending March 2020. The
estimated exposure associated with the parallel yield curve shift of minus 100
basis points in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in
short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest
rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and
1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities
contractually tied to such rates. Recent Fed Funds increases have resulted in
a modest increase in deposit and other funding costs for Regions. Therefore,
it is expected that declines in funding costs will only partially offset the
decline in asset yields. A reduction in intermediate and long-term interest
rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage
rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or
renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio
purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities
in the investment portfolio. At current rate levels, the interest income
sensitivity afforded by potential further extension of investment securities
and the resulting impact on premium amortization is reduced, making
intermediate and long-term interest rate sensitivity primarily attributable to
changes in the level of reinvestment yields on fixed rate assets.

With respect to sensitivity along the yield curve, the balance sheet is
estimated to be asset sensitive to short-term, intermediate-term, and long-
term rates individually. Current simulation models estimate that, as compared
to the base case, net interest income and other financing income over a 12
month horizon would respond favorably by approximately $82 million if
intermediate and longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a
sustained basis exceed the base scenario by 100 basis points. Conversely, if
intermediate and longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a
sustained basis underperform the base case by 100 basis points, then net
interest income and other financing income, as compared to the base case,
would decline by approximately $119 million.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting
hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start
within the measurement horizon. Forward starting hedging relationships are
currently being used to protect net interest income and other financing income
as the macroeconomic cycle continues to evolve. Therefore, the Company's
sensitivity levels are expected to decline to be roughly neutral in early
2020. More information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in Table
19 and its accompanying description.

As market interest rates have increased in recent years, larger magnitude
falling rate shock scenarios have become possible, although the probability of
such a movement is currently low. Regions has established a scenario by which
yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The shock magnitude for
each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equates to the lesser of
-200 basis points, or a rate modestly lower than the historical all-time
minimum. This provides a sufficiently punitive rate environment, while
maintaining a higher level of reasonableness. An instantaneous shock under
this environment would be expected to reduce net interest income and other
financing income when compared to the base case by $384 million over the next
12 months.

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table
18 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the course
of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions that affect the estimates for net interest income and other
financing income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall
balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties
associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates, management
evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions.
Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be
predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet growth assumptions include moderate loan
and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of
deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by
analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on
management's expectations in the current rate environment. In the + 100 basis
point gradual interest rate change scenario in Table 18, the interest-bearing
deposit re-pricing sensitivity over the 12 month horizon is expected to be
between 50 percent and 70 percent of changes in short-term market rates (e.g.,
Fed Funds). A 5 percentage point higher sensitivity than the baseline
assumption would decrease 12 month net interest income and other financing
income in the gradual +100 basis points scenario by approximately $22 million.
While the estimates should be used as a guide, differences may result driven
by the pace of rate changes, and other market and competitive factors.

Similarly, management assumes that the change in the mix of deposits in a
rising rate environment versus the baseline balance sheet growth assumptions
is informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in
rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-
bearing products will occur. As the rate cycle has progressed and a mix shift
has become inherent in the baseline forecast, management has reduced the
sensitivity impact on the shock scenarios. The magnitude of the shift is rate
dependent and equates to approximately $1.5 billion over 12 months in the
gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 18. In the event this shift
increased by an additional $1.5 billion over 12 months, the result would be a
reduction of 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the
gradual +100 basis points scenario by approximately $19 million.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
stockholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar

  

72

futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into
to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments.
The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the
size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow
the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price
and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market
instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign
currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a
specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf
of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another
party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position and available for sale securities portfolios to a variable-rate
position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination of
short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1 month LIBOR.  
  
A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated above in Table 19
are forward starting, and therefore do not impact, or have limited impact to
the estimated annual change in net interest income discussed in Table 18. As
of March 31, 2019, $4.75 billion notional of the outstanding cash flow swaps
were forward starting. All interest rate floors are forward starting. Forward
starting swaps and floors have maturities of approximately five years from
their respective start dates. Subsequent to March 31, 2019, the Company
executed $750 million notional of forward starting cash flow swaps and $1.0
billion notional of forward starting floors with similar characteristics,
start dates and maturities, to the forward starting hedges already transacted.
Inclusive of these contracts, the total receive rate and strike price on all
forward starting cash flow swaps and floors was 2.7 percent and 2.1 percent,
respectively.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All interest rate swap derivatives traded
by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains more
information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note
9 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-
end derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative and balance sheet transactions to economically mitigate the impact
of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative
instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the
current risk profile of Regions' current portfolio.

MARKET RISK--PREPAYMENT RISK

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment
speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments.
Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net
interest income and other financing income. For example, mortgage loans and
other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may
refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets
prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in
lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce
Regions' interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising
rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in
opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates.
Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value
of equity. Regions' greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in
its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan
portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to
interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment
risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates,
but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or
indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and
financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either
encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is
extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors.
The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable
expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided.
Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest
income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSR. Regions
actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest
income and other financing income forecasting and interest rate risk
management.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. The liquidity coverage ratio rule is designed
to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary assets on hand to
withstand short-term liquidity disruptions. See the "Liquidity Coverage Ratio"
discussion included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. See Note 12 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to
the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the
Company's funding requirements. Regions also has obligations related to
potential litigation contingencies.

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, borrowed funds and stockholders' equity. Regions' goal in liquidity
management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs.
Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company's funding
requirements is important.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions
performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at
the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy
requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater
of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash
balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company
totaled $2.3 billion at March 31, 2019. Compliance with the holding company
cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a
quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank
and subsidiaries. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not
currently include any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits
are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity
Policy. The Company's Board, LROC, and ALCO regularly review compliance with
the established limits.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt
Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various
secured borrowing capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds.
Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one-to-four
family residential first mortgage loans. Regions' liquidity is further
enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can
also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although
Regions does not currently rely on short-term unsecured wholesale market
funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At March 31, 2019, Regions
had approximately $2.1 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase
from approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of March 31, 2019, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $19.8 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2019, Regions'
outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was $8.5 billion and its total
borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled $17.5 billion. FHLB borrowing
capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB.
Regions Bank pledged certain securities, commercial and real estate mortgage
loans, residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family dwellings and
home equity lines of credit as collateral for the FHLB advances outstanding.
Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of
outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to the
consolidated financial statements in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a
reliable and economical source of funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings" to the consolidated financial
statements in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has a diversified loan portfolio in terms of product
type, collateral and geography. See Table 2 for further details of each loan
portfolio segment. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of
risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security
risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks
that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, including
technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the
increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to
conduct more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states,
activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify
and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its
information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and
vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems
and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls
are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and
transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing
practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure
its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the
resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue
to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to protect its
systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a
strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due
diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.

Regions' system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide
protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security
matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient
resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively
engaged in the oversight of Regions' continuous efforts to reinforce and
enhance its operational resilience. The Board monitors Regions' information
management risk policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee,
which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology
activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and
cybersecurity; approval and oversight of information security risk
assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery,
business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board's
Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions' cybersecurity practices, mainly by
receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the
Chief Information Security Officer, risk management, and Internal Audit. The
Board, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on
information security matters.

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to
gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions
to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is
a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services
sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third
party

that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and
incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information
that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members
for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC, Regions is a
member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its members by
providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics.

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation.
These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions
in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant
resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these
measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure,
Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading
consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also
developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans
that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the
effects of any such event. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to data
breaches may be offset by applicable insurance.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations
and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of
its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and
monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions'
reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event.

  

PROVISION (CREDIT) FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision (credit) for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for
loan losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb
probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The
provision (credit) for loan losses totaled $91 million in the first quarter of
2019 compared to $(10) million during the first quarter of 2018. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis
for further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund fees and other service charges. The increase
during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 was
primarily due to continued customer account growth and increases in non-
sufficient fund activity.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that includes securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger
and acquisition and other advisory services. The decrease in the first quarter
of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to lower fees
generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers.
Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in merger and acquisition
advisory services.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage
income during the first three months of 2019 compared to the same period in
2018 was primarily due to reduction in the valuation of mortgage serving
rights and related hedges, lower production and lower sales revenue. The
decreases were partially offset by an increase in servicing income.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance increased in the first
quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to an
increase in claims benefits and favorable market adjustments.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. The net loss incurred
during the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to the sale of certain
lower-yielding securities.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and other, are the reflection
of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee
benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit assets - other are
offset in salaries and benefits.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees
from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net
revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting
from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the
investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income was
relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period
in 2018. However, there were certain transactions in each quarter that offset.
During the first quarter of 2018, $7 million in net gains associated with the
sale of certain low income housing investments were recorded. During the first
quarter of 2019, an $8 million gain associated with the sale of $167 million
of affordable housing residential mortgage loans was recognized.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits decreased for the first
quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to staffing
reductions and lower severance charges. Severance charges totaled $2 million
for first quarter 2019 compared to $15 million for first quarter 2018. Full-

continuing operations decreased to 20,056 at March 31, 2019 from 20,666 at
March 31, 2018, reflecting the impact of the Company's efficiency initiatives
implemented as part of its strategic priorities.

Professional fees--Professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of
amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory
charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses decreased during the
first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to
lower consulting fees.

FDIC insurance assessments--FDIC insurance assessments decreased in the first
quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 due to the discontinuation
of the FDIC assessment surcharge that was implemented during the third quarter
of 2016 and was in place throughout the first nine months of 2018.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses
and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other
miscellaneous expenses increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to
the same period of 2018 primarily due to an increase in non-service related
pension costs associated with a lower discount rate as well as higher
operational losses.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense from continuing operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2019 was $105 million and $128 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2018, resulting in effective taxes rates of 21.0
percent and 23.6 percent, respectively. The Company expects the full-year
effective tax rate to be 20 to 22 percent for 2019.

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the
level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions
with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing
investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible
expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may
occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such
as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments,
valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits.
Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may
be impacted.

At March 31, 2019, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $120
million compared to a net deferred tax asset of $20 million at December 31,
2018. This change was due primarily to a decrease in the deferred tax asset
related to unrealized losses on available for sale securities and derivative
instruments.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. Morgan Keegan was sold
on April 2, 2012.

Regions' results from discontinued operations are presented in Note 3
"Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results
from discontinued operations for both the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 were
immaterial.

materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial reporting.

Regions' Board authorized, effective June 28, 2018, a new $2.031 billion
common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the
third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. As of
March 31, 2019, Regions has repurchased approximately 102.6 million shares of
common stock, through open market purchases and a contractual repurchase
agreement, at a total cost of $1.8 billion under this plan. The Company also
continued to repurchase shares on the open market under its capital plan in
the second quarter of 2019. As of May 7, 2019, Regions had repurchased
approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of
approximately $74.5 million. All of these shares were immediately retired upon
repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury stock.
