Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factor Summary

This Annual Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate.The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that the actual
effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those
forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are
uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control. Forward-looking
statements are not based on historical information, but rather are related to
future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.
Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations as
well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available
to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based
on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also
relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the
views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we
caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These
risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those
described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in interest rates and unemployment rates, inflation, financial
market disruptions and potential reductions of economic growth, which may
adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results
and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses
and our financial results and conditions.

•Changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect
our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation,
which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially
contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally.

•The impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our businesses,
operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and severity of
any pandemic could disrupt the global economy, adversely affect our capital
and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding
loans and increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values,
and result in lost revenue or additional expenses.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law,
which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return
capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to
declining interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization
on those securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Rising interest rates could negatively impact the value of our portfolio of
investment securities.

•The loss of value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact market
perceptions of us.

•The effects of social media on market perceptions of us and banks generally.

•Volatility in the financial services industry (including failures or rumors
of failures of other depository institutions), along with actions taken by
governmental agencies to address such turmoil, could affect the ability of
depository institutions, including us, to attract and retain depositors and to
borrow or raise capital.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, such as
special FDIC assessments, as well as changes in the enforcement and
interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and
self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of the changes in U.S.
presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in
personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change
certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue,
impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum
capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and
must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by
our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to
shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our businesses.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the expected
synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not be
realized within expected timeframes, or might be less than projected; and
difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses,
such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and
other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach
of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act
or failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Our ability to identify and address operational risks associated with the
introduction of or changes to products, services, or delivery platforms.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our businesses on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and frequency of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could
impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce
demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or
damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our
reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions
Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of anti-takeover laws and exclusive forum provision in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

See also the reports filed with the SEC, including the discussion under the
"Risk Factors" section of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022 and as filed with the SEC and available on its website

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions" or the "Company") provides a full
range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the
South, Midwest and Texas as well as delivering specialty capabilities
nationwide. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all
information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a
complete presentation of financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring
items, necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements have been included. These interim financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022. Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition
and disclosure through the filing date of this Form 10-Q.

During 2023, the Company adopted new accounting guidance. See below and Note
12 for related disclosures.

MODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that
eliminated the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs while enhancing
disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made
to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, also referred to as
modifications to troubled borrowers. The guidance also requires disclosure of
current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. Regions applied the
guidance prospectively, except Regions used the modified-retrospective
transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. The
cumulative effect of the modified-retrospective application was a decrease in
the allowance of $38 million and an increase to retained earnings of $28
million, net of taxes. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" and Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information
regarding TDRs and the related allowance for credit loss accounting prior to
the adoption of modifications to troubled borrowers guidance.

Modifications to troubled borrowers

Modifications to troubled borrowers are loans where the borrower is
experiencing financial difficulty at the time of modification and are
undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of repayment. Modification types
classified as modifications to troubled borrowers include interest rate
reductions, other than insignificant term extensions, other than insignificant
payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or any combination of these. Further
details are as follows:

•Interest rate reduction modifications include instances where the absolute
interest rate is reduced as part of the modification. In instances where the
rate index changes for variable-rate loans, Regions evaluates whether or not
the absolute interest rate decreases from the original rate to the updated
rate.

•Term extensions are maturity extensions, many of which occur through renewals
or restructurings.

•Payment deferrals include modifications wherein the contractual payment term
is extended. Examples of payment deferral modifications include, but are not
limited to, re-agings, payment delays or holidays, lengthening of amortization
terms, allowing for an interest-only payment period, and capitalizing interest
payments in loan restructurings.

•Regions rarely grants principal forgiveness modifications.

Modifications to troubled borrowers are subject to policies governing
accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of the same
product type as discussed in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022. As such, modifications to troubled borrowers may include loans remaining
on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status,
depending on the individual facts and circumstances.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance is intended to cover expected credit losses over the contractual
life of loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments. Upon
the adoption of modifications to troubled borrowers guidance in January 2023,
the Company eliminated TDR and reasonable expectations of a TDR ("RETDR")
designations and specific measurement rules within the calculation of the
allowance credit losses, which resulted in a decrease to the allowance upon
application of the modified-retrospective transition method discussed above.

Table of Contents

  

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for previous
discussion of allowance measurement methodology for these items.

Modifications identified as modifications to troubled borrowers have no
separate or distinct allowance measurement rules under the new guidance. As
such, these loans are included in their respective loan pools (if they do not
qualify for specific evaluation) and expected losses are determined by the
Company's allowance models and qualitative framework.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The method and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of certain
financial instruments new to 2023 is discussed below. Refer to Note 1 "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information regarding fair value
measurements.

Short-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings reported
in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the estimated fair values, and
are considered Level 2 measurements as similar instruments are traded in
active markets.

(1)The gross unrealized losses recognized in OCI on securities held to
maturity resulted from a transfer of securities available for sale to held to
maturity in the second quarter of 2013.

Debt securities with carrying values of $11.9 billion and $8.8 billion at
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, were pledged to secure
public funds, trust deposits and other borrowing arrangements.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at March 31, 2023, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The following tables present gross unrealized losses and the related estimated
fair value of debt securities held to maturity and debt securities available
for sale at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For debt securities
transferred to held to maturity from available for sale, the analysis in the
tables below compares the securities' original amortized cost to its current
estimated fair value. All securities in an unrealized position are segregated
between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position
for less than twelve months and for twelve months or more.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above decreased from 1,806 at December 31, 2022 to 1,763 at March 31,
2023. The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2022 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss represented credit impairment as of those dates.
The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of
their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale were immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2023.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. As
part of the Company's normal process for evaluating impairment, management did
not identify any positions where impairment was believed to exist in either of
the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate, and
consumer. Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to
Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2022 for information regarding Regions' portfolio
segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal
banking regulators' definitions and are utilized to develop the associated
allowance. Refer to Note 5 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for information regarding
commercial risk ratings.

Regions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique
credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices,
and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio.
FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal
underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans.
Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for
various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an
updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop
the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less
probability of default and vice versa.

The following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, by vintage year
as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Gross charge-offs are also
presented by vintage year for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as a
result of the prospective adoption of new accounting guidance. See Note 1 and
Note 12 for additional information. Classes in the commercial and investor
real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes in the
consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer to Note

MODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY

Modifications to troubled borrowers are loans where the borrower is
experiencing financial difficulty at the time of modification and are
undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of repayment. Typical
modifications include accommodations such as renewals and forbearances. The
majority of Regions' commercial and investor real estate modifications to
troubled borrowers are the result of renewals of classified loans wherein
there has been an interest rate reduction and/or maturity extension (that is
considered other than insignificant). Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of troubled consumer borrowers through its CAP. Regions
designed the program to allow for customer-tailored modifications with the
goal of keeping customers in their homes and avoiding foreclosure where
possible. Modifications may be offered to any borrower experiencing financial
hardship regardless of the borrower's payment status. Consumer modifications
to troubled borrowers primarily involve an interest rate reduction and/or a
payment deferral or maturity extension that is considered other than
insignificant. All CAP modifications that involve an interest rate reduction,
principal forgiveness, other than insignificant payment deferral or term
extension and/or a combination of these are disclosed as modifications to
troubled borrowers because the customer documents a financial hardship in
order to participate. Refer to Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" for additional
information regarding the Company's modifications to troubled borrowers.

For each portfolio segment and class, the following table presents the end of
period balance of new modifications to troubled borrowers and the related
percentage of the loan portfolio period-end balance by the type of
modification. During the period presented, the Company did not make any
modifications of principal forgiveness.

Prior to the Company's adoption of new guidance related to modifications to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, Regions accounted for loans in
which the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty at the modification
date and wherein Regions had granted a concession to the borrower as a TDR.
Like modifications to troubled borrowers, TDRs were undertaken in order to
improve the likelihood of repayment of a loan. However, TDR modifications were
different because they may have had a stated interest rate lower than the
current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications to the
structure of the loan that fell outside of normal underwriting policies and
procedures, or in limited circumstances forgiveness of principal and/or
interest. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and
Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information.

The following table presents the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the period presented in 2022 by portfolio segment and class, and
the financial impact of those modifications. The table includes modifications
made to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

(1)Purchases of residential MSRs can be structured with cash hold back
provisions, therefore the timing of payment may be made in future periods.

(2)Includes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR
decay methodology is a discounted net cash flow approach.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| March 31  
| 2023| | 2022  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 54,557 | | | $| 41,639 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 7.7 | %| | 9.6 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (43)| | | $| (48)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (84)| | | $| (78)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 546 | | | 445 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (19)| | | $| (10)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (38)| | | $| (21)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.6 | %| | 3.5 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 306| | 299  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.1 | | | 27.4 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

Servicing related fees, which include contractually specified servicing fees,
late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of
residential mortgage loans totaled $38 million and $27 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. Regions' related DUS commercial MSRs are recorded
in other assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are amortized
in proportion to, and over the estimated period that net servicing income is
expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of
estimated future net cash flows. See Note 1 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information. Also see Note
11 for additional information related to the guarantee.

Regions' DUS portfolio totaled $79 million and $81 million at March 31, 2023
and December 31, 2022, respectively. Regions periodically evaluates DUS MSRs
for impairment based on fair value. The estimated fair value of the DUS
commercial MSRs was approximately $94 million at March 31, 2023 and $96
million at December 31, 2022.

Servicing related fees in connection with the DUS program, which include
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income
resulting from the servicing of DUS commercial mortgage loans totaled $5
million and $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.

All series of preferred stock have no stated maturity and redemption is solely
at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part,
after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, at any time
following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B, Series C,
Series D, and Series E preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared a total of $24 million in cash dividends on
all series of preferred stock during both the first three months of 2023 and
2022.

In the event Series B, Series C, Series D or Series E preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $67 million, $10 million, $4 million, or
$10 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to common shareholders'
equity. The remaining amounts listed represent issuance costs that were
recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will
be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

Regions' 2022 stress testing results from the FRB reflected that the Company
exceeded all minimum capital levels and the SCB will be floored at 2.5 percent
for the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023.

On April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion
of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of
2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2023, Regions had
repurchased approximately 725 thousand shares of common stock at a total cost
of $15 million under this plan. All of these shares were immediately retired
upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions also enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate prepayable and non-prepayable debt securities available for sale. These
agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-
rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swaps, options (e.g., floors, caps and
collars), and agreements with a combination of these instruments to manage
overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable
rate loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to
interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR or SOFR interest rate
swaps and interest rate floors. As of March 31, 2023, Regions is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows into 2029.

The following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges
on AOCI. The balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI will be amortized
into earnings through 2026.

Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $215 million in pre-
tax expenses due to the net receipt/ payment of interest and amortization on
all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is
$33 million in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of terminated
cash flow hedges.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Regions had $212 million and $118
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
Regions had $350 million and $233 million, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage
income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and
corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans
are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $3.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2023 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2023 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of March 31, 2023 was approximately $483 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at March 31, 2023 and
2022 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were $27 million and $17 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $29 million and $20
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis:

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4 .

The following tables present detailed information regarding material assets
and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The tables include the
valuation techniques and the significant unobservable inputs utilized. The
range of each significant unobservable input as well as the weighted-average
within the range utilized at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are
included. Following the tables are descriptions of the valuation techniques
and the sensitivity of the techniques to changes in the significant
unobservable inputs.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

As discussed above, the Company elected the option to measure certain
commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. At March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, the balance of these loans was immaterial.

The Company has elected the option to measure certain commercial and
industrial loans held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively
traded in the secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value
estimates for substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation
service that is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans
are traded in the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject
to variability and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these
loans held for sale was immaterial at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
first mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows
for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the
derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of
complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Fair values of
residential first mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market
prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at
market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include
servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for
sale.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale.
The following table details net gains and losses resulting from changes in
fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale, which were recorded in
mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. These changes in fair value are mostly
offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts
was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include loans held for
sale for which the fair value option has not been elected, foreclosed property
and other real estate and equity investments without a readily determinable
fair value; all of which may be considered either Level 2 or Level 3 valuation
measurements. Non-recurring fair value adjustments related to loans held for
sale, foreclosed property and other real estate are typically a result of the
application of lower of cost or fair value accounting during the period. Non-
recurring fair value adjustments related to equity investments without readily
determinable fair values are the result of impairments or price changes from
observable transactions. The balances of each of these assets, as well as the
related fair value adjustments during the periods, were immaterial at both
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior periods were updated to reflect
these enhancements.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the periods indicated:

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 23 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| March 31, 2023| | December 31, 2022  
| (In millions)

Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 33 | | | 37 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 124| | 118 |  
  
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to actual or threatened
legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory matters, arising in the
ordinary course of business. Litigation matters range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits and can involve claims
for substantial or indeterminate alleged damages or for injunctive or other
relief. Regulatory investigations and enforcement matters may involve formal
or informal proceedings and other inquiries initiated by various governmental
agencies, law enforcement authorities, and self-regulatory organizations, and
can result in fines, penalties, restitution, changes to Regions' business
practices, and other related costs, including reputational damage. At any
given time, these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication,
arbitration, or investigation, and may relate to a variety of topics,
including common law tort and contract claims, as well as statutory consumer
protection-related claims, among others.

Assessment of exposure that could result from legal proceedings is complex
because these proceedings often involve inherently unpredictable factors,
including, but not limited to, the following: whether the proceeding is in
early stages; whether damages or the amount of potential fines, penalties, and
restitution are unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a
potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves
legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter
involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery or other
investigation has begun or is not complete; whether material facts may be
disputed or unsubstantiated; whether meaningful settlement discussions have
commenced; and whether the matter involves class allegations. As a result of
these complexities, Regions may be unable to develop an estimate or range of
loss.

Regions evaluates legal proceedings based on information currently available,
including advice of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters
when a loss is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Additionally, when it is practicable and reasonably possible that
it may experience losses in excess of established accruals, Regions estimates
possible loss contingencies. Regions currently estimates that the aggregate
amount of reasonably possible losses that it may experience, in excess of what
has been accrued, is immaterial. While the final outcomes of legal proceedings

41

* * *

Table of Contents

  

are inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcomes of pending and threatened matters will not have a material effect on
Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole.

As available information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to
estimate, as well as the estimates themselves, will be adjusted accordingly.
Regions' estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and
the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. In the
event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that an adverse
outcome in any such matter could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a
whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence.

Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by
applicable insurance coverage. However, in determining the amounts of any
accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies, Regions does not take
into account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that
Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the
recovery is received.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions sells commercial loans to Fannie Mae through the DUS lending program
and through other platforms. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal
balance for the majority of the commercial servicing portfolio. At March 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled
approximately $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Regions has
additional loans sold to Fannie Mae outside of the DUS program that are also
subject to a loss share guarantee and at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
these serviced loans totaled approximately $550 million and $655 million,
respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to
all loans subject to a loss share guarantee was approximately $1.8 billion at
both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company would be liable for
this amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the
Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral
underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of
settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not
representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The
estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a
liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was immaterial at both
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 1 in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information.

write-offs.

The amendments in the Update eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by
creditors that have adopted CECL while enhancing disclosure requirements for
certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty.

The Update also requires that a public business entity disclose current-period
gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net
investment in leases.

The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively, except for the
transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs for which
there is an option to apply a modified retrospective transition method,
resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period
of adoption.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K. See
Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements"
to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of
this discussion will be on the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2022 for the consolidated statements of
income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion
will be the balances as of March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 6 through 8 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. In addition, Regions operates
several offices delivering specialty capabilities in New York, Washington
D.C., Chicago and other locations nationwide. Regions provides financial
solutions for a wide range of clients including retail and mortgage banking
services, commercial banking services and wealth and investment services.
Further, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including
merger and acquisition advisory services, capital market solutions, home
improvement lending and others.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At March 31, 2023, Regions operated 1,285 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment
Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

First Quarter Operating Environment

In the first quarter of 2023, the banking industry was impacted by the failure
of two U.S depository institutions. Outside of the U.S, an international bank
also suffered a crisis in confidence. The circumstances surrounding these
events were largely driven by a sudden decline in deposits and lack of
available liquidity to replace the deposit declines at the institutions. In
March 2023, the BTFP was created by the Federal Reserve to support American
businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible
depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the
needs of all their depositors, as an additional source of liquidity against
high-quality securities, eliminating an institution's need to quickly sell
those securities in times of stress. In addition to the uncertainty brought by
these events, the Federal Reserve delivered two

additional 25 basis-point rate hikes as inflation continued to stay above
target levels. Accordingly, there is now heightened focus on the banking
industry as a whole. Regions believes that its deposits are diversified across
stable categories and are granular in nature which lessens the probability of
sudden declines in deposits. Additionally, Regions maintains a variety of
liquidity sources to fund its obligations and performs various evaluations to
determine appropriate levels of available liquidity. See the discussion below
and within the "Debt Securities", "Deposits", "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk"
and "Liquidity" sections for further information.

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

After full-year 2022 real GDP growth of 2.1 percent, the March 2023 baseline
forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 1.4 percent in 2023. The pace of
economic activity remains restrained by elevated inflation and higher interest
rates. Spending in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, most notably
housing, has slowed, and while there are indications that supply chain and
logistics constraints have eased, they have not entirely subsided. Though
there are signs that the demand for labor is cooling, the labor market remains
tight and firms in many industry groups continue to struggle to fill job
vacancies. Though the pace of inflation has slowed, it remains considerably
above the FOMC's target rate and one or more further hikes in the Fed funds
rate in 2023 cannot be ruled out. The economic data and the financial markets
remain quite volatile, and recent stresses in the banking system have raised
concerns that credit conditions could tighten to the point the economy slips
into recession. These factors are contributing to considerable uncertainty
around the near-term economic outlook.

Real GDP growth grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent in the first
quarter, but a modest draw in nonfarm business inventories deducted 2.3
percentage points from top-line real GDP growth. Real private domestic demand,
or, combined business and household spending, grew at an annual rate of 2.9
percent in the first quarter. Much of that growth, however, reflects an
outsized increase in real consumer spending in January, when inflation-
adjusted consumer spending increased by 1.4 percent before falling by 0.2
percent in February and into March. Though consumer deposit balances remain
above pre-pandemic levels, they have declined as expected. While growth in
labor earnings has helped support growth in personal income, the cumulative
effects of rapid inflation have posed an increasing burden on household
finances. At the same time, higher interest rates have made it more costly to
finance purchases of consumer durable goods. As such, meaningfully slower
growth in consumer spending is expected over the months ahead.

The housing market continues to feel effects of higher mortgage interest
rates, which are expected to remain a drag on construction and sales of single
family homes in 2023. House prices have begun to decline in many markets, and
Regions' forecast anticipates a mid-single digit decline nationally in 2023
with larger declines in those markets which saw significantly above-average
rates of price appreciation in 2021 and the first half of 2022. That said,
applications for purchase mortgage loans have responded to dips in interest
rates, which reflects remaining pent-up demand for home purchases stemming
from the market having been undersupplied over the past several years. Lower
house prices should have much the same impact, with improvements in
affordability leading to modestly increasing home sales over the back half of
2023.

Facing an uncertain outlook for demand, many firms have begun to scale back
capital spending plans, which is apparent in the data showing sharply slowing
growth giving way to outright declines in orders for core capital goods. That
said, businesses continue to invest in technology and automation to counter
persistent labor supply constraints, and business spending on structures has
seen signs of life of late, in part reflecting onshoring of production
activity, such as the semiconductor chip plants springing up across the U.S.
This should sustain at least moderate growth in business investment over
coming quarters.

Recent data show the number of job vacancies falling to the lowest level since
May 2021, but the number of job vacancies remains well above the number of
potential workers and the rate at which workers are voluntarily quitting jobs
remains above pre-pandemic norms. Reflecting the sharp slowdown in real GDP
growth, the number of job vacancies are expected to fall further and the pace
of job growth is expected to slow sharply in the months ahead, to the point
that the unemployment rate rises, pushing over 4.0 percent. Despite a
pronounced slowdown in the pace of job growth, firms in most industry groups
will likely be hesitant to let large numbers of workers go in response to a
slowdown in demand they expect will be short-lived. This is a reflection of
how hard it has been for firms to attract and retain labor since the onset of
the pandemic, and if this does prove to be the case it would limit the extent
of any increase in the unemployment rate. One exception has been the tech
sector, in which significant numbers of layoffs have followed a period of
notably aggressive hiring. Additionally, the ongoing contraction in
manufacturing could bring layoffs in that sector if expectations of recovery
are pushed further out into the future.

While inflation is past its peak, progress continues to come at a pace too
slow for the FOMC's comfort, and inflation is expected to remain above the
Committee's 2.0 percent target rate through most of 2024. Moreover, recent
increases in energy prices, if sustained, pose upside risk to forecasts of
headline inflation. To the extent the demand for labor is cooling, that will
give the FOMC comfort that services price inflation will begin to moderate,
and if further softening in consumer spending on discretionary services
occurs, that would further blunt inflation pressures. While another 25-basis
point Fed funds rate hike seems the most likely outcome, the FOMC must balance
concerns over inflation against concerns over financial stability in light of
recent stresses in the banking system. Either way, once the FOMC reaches a
stopping point, expectations are that they will hold the funds rate steady at
the terminal rate for some time to come.

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be
broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. A number of states
within the footprint have seen heightened flows of domestic in-migration since
the onset of the pandemic, which has resulted in more rapid rates of job
growth and more rapid growth in housing costs. It is likely that migration
patterns will shift in 2023 as the broader economy and the labor market slow.
That said, job growth for the Company's footprint as a whole is expected to be
faster than that for the U.S. as a whole. That Regions' footprint has an
above-average exposure to manufacturing means the contraction in the
manufacturing sector could be felt more acutely, but the larger, more
industrially diverse areas of the footprint are expected to continue to
outperform. Some of the metro areas which over the past two years saw the
largest increases in house prices could experience price declines in excess of
the national average, but continued robust population growth in these markets
will help stem significant declines in house prices.

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions'
forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of March 31, 2023. See the
"Allowance" section for further information.

First Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $588 million
or $0.62 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net income
available to common shareholders of $524 million or $0.55 per diluted share in
the first quarter of 2022.The primary driver of the increase in net income
from the prior year period was higher net interest income.

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $1.4 billion in the
first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 4.22 percent in the
first quarter of 2023, reflecting a 137 basis point increase from the same
period in 2022. The increase in net interest income and net interest margin
was primarily driven by a significant increase in market interest rates,
average loan growth, and a larger average securities portfolio year-over-year.
A decline in average cash balances also supported the increase in net interest
margin. Higher interest expense on deposits and overall funding costs, as
expected in a rising rate environment, partially offset the increases in
interest income.

The provision for credit losses totaled $135 million in the first quarter of
2023 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $36 million in 2022. The
current quarter provision reflects deteriorating economic conditions and
continued normalization of asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $83 million,
or 0.35 percent of average loans, in the first quarter of 2023, compared to
$46 million, or 0.21 percent in 2022, reflecting increased net charge-offs in
the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. While net charge-offs increased,
the allowance remained stable at 1.63 percent of total loans, net of unearned
income at March 31, 2023, unchanged from December 31, 2022. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $534 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to
$584 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower capital
markets income, mortgage income and service charges on deposit accounts. The
declines were partially offset by improvement in investment service fee income
and market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets. See Table 22
"Non-Interest Income" for further details.

Non-interest expense was $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to
$933 million in 2022. The increase was driven by several expense categories,
primarily salaries and employee benefits expense. These increases were
partially offset by lower credit and checkcard expenses. See Table 23 "Non-
Interest Expense" for further details.

Regions' effective tax rate was 22.4 percent in 2023 compared to 21.9 percent
in 2022. See the "Income Taxes" section for further details.

Capital

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies, which include
quantitative requirements including the CET1 ratio. At March 31, 2023,
Regions' CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.88 percent. For additional
information on Regions' regulatory capital requirements see the "Regulatory
Requirements" section.

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal
Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to
the consolidated financial statements for further details.

The Board authorized, on April 20, 2022, the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion
of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of
2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company did not repurchase any
shares in the first quarter of 2023.

(1)Expectation for CET1 is to manage at or modestly above 10 percent over the
near term.

(2)Expectation includes a net interest income expectation of a decline of
1.5-3.5 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter,
but expect full-year 2023 net interest income growth of 12-14 percent. The net
interest income expectation utilizes the March 31, 2023 forward interest rate
curve which includes 75bps of rate cuts in 2023. A stable Fed funds level
would push full-year 2023 net interest income to the upper end of the full-
year net interest income range.

(3)Expectation includes expectations with regard to select non-interest
revenue categories. Overdraft policy changes to be implemented in mid-2023 are
expected to result in full-year service charges of approximately $550 million.
Capital markets revenue is expected to range between $60 million to $80
million excluding valuation adjustments on customer derivatives in the second
quarter of 2023. Mortgage income is expected to be lower in 2023 compared to
2022, but remain a key component of fee revenue.

(4)Expectation reflects an estimated increase in second quarter 2023
operational losses resulting from check fraud, which has been an industry-wide
issue.

(5)Normalized through-the-cycle net charge-offs range is expected to be 35-45
bps.

The reconciliation with respect to these forward-looking non-GAAP measures is
expected to be consistent with the actual non-GAAP reconciliations within
Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q. For more information
related to the Company's 2023 expectations, refer to the related sub-sections
discussed in more detail within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this
Form 10-Q.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $2.4 billion from year-end
2022 to March 31, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit with
the FRB partially offset by an increase in cash due from other banks. In the
first quarter 2023, the net decline in cash was driven by an expected decline
in deposits and growth in loans, partially offset by an increase in short-term
borrowings. See the "Loans", "Liquidity", "Deposits", and "Borrowed Funds"
sections for more information.

DEBT SECURITIES

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including
both available for sale and held to maturity:

| | | | |  
| | | | |  
  
Debt securities available for sale, comprising 21 percent of earning assets,
constitute approximately 97 percent of the securities portfolio. They are an
important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary
source of liquidity for the Company, as much of the portfolio is highly
liquid. Additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used
as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. See the "Liquidity"
section for more information on these arrangements. Regions maintains a
highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency MBS. See Note
2 "Debt Securities" to the

47

Table of Contents

  

consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also see the
"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" section for more information.

The average life of the debt securities portfolio at March 31, 2023 was
estimated to be 5.7 years, with a duration of approximately 4.8 years. These
metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.8 years and a duration of
approximately 4.8 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2022.

Debt securities increased $286 million from December 31, 2022 to March 31,
2023 primarily driven by increases in federal agency securities and
residential agency securities. During the first quarter of 2023, Regions made
no purchases of debt securities available for sale outside of normal
reinvestment of maturities and paydowns.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $564 million at March 31, 2023, consisting of $203
million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $316 million of commercial
loans, $44 million of consumer and other performing loans, and $1 million of
non-performing loans. At December 31, 2022, loans held for sale totaled $354
million, consisting of $160 million of residential real estate mortgage loans,
$153 million of commercial loans, $38 million of consumer and other performing
loans, and $3 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real
estate mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage
originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to
third parties. Commercial loans held for sale include commercial mortgage
loans originated for sale to third parties and commercial loans originally
recorded as held for investment when management has the intent to sell. Levels
of commercial loans held for sale fluctuate based on timing of sale to third
parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented 72 percent of interest-earning
assets as of March 31, 2023. The following table presents the distribution of
Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned
income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2 , explain changes in balances from year-end 2022
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional discussion.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $749 million since year-end 2022, driven by a
continued increase in line utilization and expansion of existing lines. In the
first quarter of 2023, commercial and industrial loan growth was broad-based,
primarily driven by increases in the utilities and retail trade industries.

The commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business
operations. Owner-

48

Table of Contents

  

occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

(1)"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $53 million in comparison to 2022 year-
end balances.

(1)Owner-occupied commercial real estate is not included as the principal
source of repayment is individual businesses, which more closely aligns with
the commercial portfolio credit performance.

(2)Amounts calculated based on whole dollar values.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $362 million in comparison to 2022 year-end balances,
driven by approximately $580 million in new loan originations retained on the
balance sheet, including ARM production, through the first three months of
2023. Existing balances were supported by slightly lower prepayment rates.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased $113 million in comparison to 2022 year-end
balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, the
predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon
maturity. The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments
required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March
31, 2023. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of
this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans.

Other Consumer--Exit Portfolios

Other consumer--exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third
parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other
point of sale lending. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these
businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balance has decreased $82
million from year-end 2022.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans,
overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $151
million from year-end 2022 primarily driven by increases in consumer home
improvement loans.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for most consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses".

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments
includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding
unfunded loan commitments.

The allowance totaled $1.6 billion at both March 31,2023 and December 31,
2022, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the
life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of March 31, 2023. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the
allowance models and continues to be at normalized level with forecasted
periods expected to remain relatively consistent.

In deriving any forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with
external forecasts and external data available. Regions' March 2023 baseline
forecast weakened compared to the December 2022 forecast driven by several
factors. Weak growth in real GDP is expected in 2023, with the key driver of
growth in overall business investment being intellectual property products. A
pronounced slowdown in job growth is anticipated, as well as a low labor force
participation rate that will limit any increase in the unemployment rate over
the forecast horizon. As measured by CPI, inflation is expected to slow
further but remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target through 2024. Renewed
disruptions in global supply chains and shipping networks, excessive monetary
policy tightening, and heightened financial volatility provide significant
downside uncertainty over the near-term forecast. See the Economic Environment
in Regions' Banking Markets discussion in the "First Quarter Overview" section
for additional information.

Credit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter in order to understand
external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions'
internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. In the first quarter of
2023, asset quality continued to normalize, as expected, within certain select
sectors of the commercial and consumer portfolios. Total net charge-offs
increased $14 million. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances
increased approximately $576 million, which included an increase in classified
balances of $182 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-
performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non performing assets increased
approximately $54 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This
continued normalization resulted in a modest increase to the modeled results
in the allowance for credit losses.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The March 31, 2023 general imprecision
allowance increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to
uncertainty in the economic forecast.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$1.6 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of March 31, 2023.

  

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from previous years' totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance for
Credit Losses". Net charge-offs increased $37 million year-over-year,
primarily driven by

54

* * *

Table of Contents

  

an increase in commercial and industrial and other consumer net charge-offs.
As noted, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in
commodity prices, collateral valuations and inflationary pressure will impact
the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain
credit metrics during the remainder of 2023 and beyond. See the "First Quarter
Overview" section for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2023.

but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due
guaranteed loans excluded were $30 million at March 31, 2023 and $34 million
at December 31, 2022.

Non-performing loans at March 31, 2023 increased $52 million as compared to
year-end levels as a result of continued asset quality normalization. There
were increases in several industry sectors, with no overarching industry
sector being the driver. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment,
volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the
future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually
large credits could also result in volatility.

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 9
"Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the
methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions
also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking
services through the Company's digital channels and contact center.

____

(1) Other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of
wholesale funding (for example, Eurodollar trade deposits, selected deposits
and brokered time deposits).

Total deposits at March 31, 2023 decreased approximately $3.3 billion compared
to year-end 2022 levels, largely in line with expectations. In the first
quarter, corporate deposits declined approximately $2.0 billion, primarily in
non-interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing checking, reflecting normal
seasonal activity. Declines of approximately $1.4 billion in wealth management
and higher-balance consumer deposits, primarily in interest-bearing checking
and money market, reflect continued rate-seeking behavior. However, the
liquidity concerns in the banking industry in the month of March 2023 did not
have a significant impact on Regions' deposit levels. The deposit outflows
primarily occurred prior to early March 2023. The deposit declines were
partially offset by an increase in time deposits as interest rates have
increased.

Regions believes that its deposits are diversified across stable categories
and include insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making
up more than 60 percent of the total deposit base. Furthermore, corporate
deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use
is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other
cash management activities). A significant amount of the Company's deposit
base is insured by the FDIC or collateralized,with approximately $9.6 billion
in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at March 31, 2023. The
amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $46.8 billion at March 31,
2023, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits are insured by the FDIC. The
Company's deposits are also granular in nature as evidenced by an average
deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at March 31, 2023. The
estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on
methodologies used in the Company's Call Report, which is prepared on an
unconsolidated bank basis.

See the "First Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations for
deposits in 2023. See also the "Liquidity" and "Market Risk-Interest Rate
Risk" sections for further discussion.

BORROWED FUNDS

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, were $2 billion at
March 31, 2023 as compared to none at December 31, 2022. These borrowings were
drawn upon in the first quarter of 2023 due to the liquidity concerns in the
banking industry that began in the month of March. The levels of these
borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the
sources utilized.

Short and long-term funding from the FHLB or FRB are secured by pledged
assets, primarily certain loan portfolios which are also subject to blanket
lien arrangements with the FHLB and FRB. As of March 31, 2023, Regions'
blanket lien arrangements with these entities covered a total loan balance of
approximately $83.8 billion and included loans from various loan portfolios.
However, borrowing capacity with the FHLB or FRB is contingent on the subset
of the blanket lien portfolios which are eligible and pledged according to the
parameters for each counterparty.

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase and FHLB advances, are a portion of Regions' funding strategy. See
the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with
the FHLB.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CAPITAL RULES

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized
approach bank. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under the FRB's rules
for tailoring enhanced prudential standards.

Federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on
regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital
was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of
subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year
period beginning in 2022. At March 31, 2023, the net impact of the addback on
CET1 was approximately $204 million or approximately 16 basis points. The add-
back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million each year, or
approximately 8 basis points, in the first quarters of 2024 and 2025.

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal
Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the
consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory requirements:

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions,
recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and
recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the
"Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section in the 2022
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory Requirements" section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additional discussion and is also included in Note 12 "Regulatory Capital
Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the
2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Requirements" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2022 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

SHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $16.9 billion at March 31, 2023 as compared to $15.9
billion at December 31, 2022. During the first three months of 2023, net
income increased shareholders' equity by $612 million, cash dividends on
common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $187 million, and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $24 million. Changes in
AOCI increased shareholders' equity by $499 million, primarily due to the net
change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during
the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cumulative effect from the adoption
of new accounting guidance that eliminated TDRs and created modifications to
troubled borrowers increased shareholders' equity by $28 million.

Total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $19 million and $4 million at
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The noncontrolling
interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit
fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at March 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" section for additional information.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest
income", "adjusted total revenue", "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent
basis", and "adjusted operating leverage ratio". Regions believes that
excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period
comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the
operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-
GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance
of Regions' business because management does not consider the activities
related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions
believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit
investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that
applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP
financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at

percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis
(non-GAAP) less the year over year percentage change in adjusted total non-
interest expense (non-GAAP). Management uses this ratio to monitor performance
and believes it provides meaningful information to investors.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

(2)Debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield and net
interest margin calculated accordingly.

(3)Loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods
presented.

(4)Interest income on loans, net of unearned income, includes hedging expense
of $15 million and hedging income $110 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest income on loans, net of
unearned income, also includes net loan fees of $29 million and $22 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(5)Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on
deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing
deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.56% and 0.04% for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(6)The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the
statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income
taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.

Net interest income is Regions' principal source of income and is one of the
most important elements of Regions' ability to meet its overall performance
goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by
market interest rates and in the first quarter of 2023, the FOMC increased the
Fed funds rate by 50 basis points.

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased by $404 million in
first quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, and net interest
margin increased by 137 basis points to 4.22 percent in first quarter 2023
compared to the same period in 2022. The increases in net interest income and
net interest margin were driven primarily by significantly higher short-term
and long-term interest rates and higher average loan balances. A decline in
average cash balances, as a result of normalizing pandemic deposits, combined
with higher interest rates also contributed to the increase in net interest
margin. Higher deposit

and funding costs, due to the rising rate environment, partially offset the
increases in net interest income and net interest margin.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. As its primary tool to analyze this risk, Regions measures the change
in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a
base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements
is a useful short-term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

In addition to net interest income simulations, Regions also utilizes an EVE
analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term
horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets,
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to
fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current
balance sheet, does not incorporate the balance sheet growth assumptions used
in the net interest income sensitivity analyses, and results are highly
dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay
optionality and indeterminate maturities. The imprecise assumptions in
preparing an EVE analysis limit its efficacy.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield
curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from
both strategic plans and customer behavior. Among the assumptions are
expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity
characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future
business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as
pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option
risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or
uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity, Regions compares a set of
alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario
derived using "market forward rates." See the "First Quarter Overview" section
for details on expectations for net interest income in 2023. The set of
alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of various magnitudes. In addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple
curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes
simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month
period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate
movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--Regions' balance sheet is naturally asset
sensitive, with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates, and
decreasing with lower interest rates. This is the result of approximately half
of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and
funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio. Importantly, the
stability and rate sensitivity of Regions' deposit portfolio has been proven
over multiple interest rate cycles. With this natural balance sheet profile,
the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the
investment portfolio and through cash flow hedges is critical for interest
rate risk management. As of March 31, 2023, Regions evidenced a mostly
balanced asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.7
years and a liability duration of approximately 3.4 years, using historically-
informed approximations. The securities portfolio duration is approximately
4.8 years and is appropriate for Regions' risk profile in order to offset the
long-duration deposit liabilities. While the available for sale securities and
cash flow hedging portfolios are recorded on the balance sheet including
current unrealized losses, deposit value increases have more than offset these
losses through the rising rate environment. The additional value of deposits
in a higher rate environment will be realized in the form of lower-cost
funding when compared with wholesale sources, which will increase realized net
interest income over time. Deposits are recorded on the balance sheet at
carrying value and, for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, the
estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is equal to their
carrying value, consistent with industry practices. However, in the
sensitivity analysis of the balance sheet management does contemplate a fair
value of deposits with no stated maturity. See Note 9 "Fair Value
Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

As of March 31, 2023, Regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and
instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the
12-month measurement horizon ending March 2024. The estimated exposure
associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in Table 18 below
reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term
interest rates. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as
the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves, 1 month LIBOR,
SOFR and BSBY) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually
tied to such rates higher or lower. Under either environment, it is expected
that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only
somewhat offset the change in asset yields.

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve
tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate
environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the
yield curve rises. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates
(such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swaps and mortgage
rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or
renewed loans, increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio
purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities
in the investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment where
intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 18 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with tightening monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of
that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions
through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and
should not be considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. In the first
quarter of 2023, Regions experienced a decline in low-cost deposit balances,
both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies, as
well as from late-cycle rate seeking behavior by higher-balance customers. The
baseline projects between $2 billion and $3 billion of additional deposit
runoff over the coming quarters, before balances stabilize and begin to
modestly expand. Assuming runoff mimics the expected total deposit mix, an
additional deposit outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by
$24 million over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in Table
18. Conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained a positive benefit of
$24 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point
scenario in Table 18.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some remixing
shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The
magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately
$4 billion over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in Table
18. Furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in
deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $25
million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net
interest income by $25 million.

The deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and
is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. In the base case
scenario, management expects an approximate 35 percent full cycle beta by
year-end 2023. The parallel +100 basis point shock scenario in Table 18 also
incorporates an incremental beta of approximately 40 percent above the base
case scenario. Incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance
of 5 percent in the parallel +100 basis point shock would increase or decrease
net interest income by approximately $40 million.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in
various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors).
The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More
information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 19 and its accompanying
description.

Regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses
derivatives, as discussed further below, and debt securities to manage its
interest rate risk position.

During the first quarter of 2023, as part of its dynamic balance sheet
management strategy, the Company executed transactions to opportunistically
terminate short-term swaps, extend incremental downside rate protection over a
longer horizon and reduce exposure to large falling rate movements where
deposit pricing is less likely to provide meaningful interest rate protection.

The Company terminated $2.25 billion of receive-fixed swaps with a weighted-
average maturity of September 2023 and a weighted-average receive-fixed rate
of 3.65 percent at opportunistic rate levels. Also during the quarter, $1.75
billion of 3-year maturity, forward starting receive-fixed swaps that become
active in January 2026, were added with a weighted-average receive-fixed rate
of 3.04 percent. Finally, the Company added $1.5 billion of forward starting
interest rate options. These options were constructed with purchased interest
rate floors at a weighted-average strike of 1.81 percent. To completely offset
the cost of these floors, the strategy includes sold interest rate caps with a
weighted-average strike of 6.23 percent.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity.

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign
exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate
contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps,
interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a
combination of these instruments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into
to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments.
The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the
size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow
the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price
and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market
instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign
currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a
specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf
of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another
party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its
fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate
position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap
derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The
counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing
broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk
mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit
Risk" section in this report contains more information on the management of
credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.

See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' year-end
derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR would not be available for use
after December 31, 2021 and would not be published after June 30, 2023.
Regions ceased origination of all new LIBOR-based lending on December 31,
2021. Existing contracts referencing USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no
later than June 30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by
the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative
products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use
LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition
Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant
business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this program, the
Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the
discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks associated with the
transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR Steering Committee.
Regions is following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates
and has been offering new benchmarks as they are adopted by regulatory
agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S.
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

•The discontinuation of LIBOR-based commercial lending on December 31, 2021,
consistent with regulatory guidelines.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

Regions has exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several lines of
business. As of March 31, 2023, Regions had the following exposures that
reference LIBOR:

•Approximately $7.9 billion of total commercial and investor real estate
loans, of which approximately $7.1 billion mature after June 30, 2023;

•Approximately $689.5 million of total consumer loans, all of which mature
after June 30, 2023;

•Securities within the investment portfolio of approximately $232 million, all
of which mature after June 30, 2023;

•Notional amount of interest rate derivatives totaling approximately $75.6
billion, of which approximately $73.1 billion mature after June 30, 2023;

•Series B and C preferred stock with total carrying values of $433 million and
$490 million, respectively, that reference LIBOR when their dividend rate
begins to float after LIBOR is no longer published. The Company expects to
transition Series B and C preferred stock to SOFR pursuant to the Adjustable
Interest Rate Act prior to the transition deadline.

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into law with
the purpose of establishing a clear and uniform process for replacing LIBOR in
existing contracts. Among the provisions of this legislation, contracts may be
transitioned to SOFR to gain a legal safe harbor. The Company has assessed the
impact of this legislation and expects to allow certain clients to fallback to
SOFR upon the cessation of LIBOR, consistent with the guidelines in the
legislation.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers.
Regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources
and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors
and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions
maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further
described below. See also Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees"
to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the
Company's funding requirements. Furthermore, Regions performs specific
procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and
maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity
risk.

68

* * *

Table of Contents

  

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity
base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans,
and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in
the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by
Regions' deposit base.

Cash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the
management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the
need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation.
As part of its normal management practice, Regions maintains collateral and
operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as FHLB (in
accordance with applicable daily limits), FRB or BTFP on a same-day basis.
While the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured
borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in
alleviating the Company's need to sell securities for funding purposes.
Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets,
though Regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the
volatility that can affect such markets.

The following table summarizes the Company's available sources of liquidity as
of March 31, 2023:

Table 21--Liquidity Sources

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Availability as of March 31, 2023  
| (in billions)  
  
Cash at the FRB(1)

Liquid securities free to use, including at BTFP(2)

| 20.7  
Liquid corporate bonds| 0.6  
Other unencumbered securities| 0.1  
FHLB borrowing availability| 13.2  
FRB borrowing availability through the discount window| 12.8  
Total liquidity sources| $| 53.8 |  
  
____

(1) Includes small in transit items that may not yet be reflected in the Fed
master account closing balance.

(2) Securities pledged under the BTFP are measured at par value, as provided
in the program, resulting in additional collateral of approximately $1.7
billion at March 31, 2023.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At March 31, 2023, Regions
had approximately $6.4 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB and other
depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $9.2 billion at
December 31, 2022, driven by the expected decline in deposits during the
period. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Deposits" sections for
more information.

The securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of
liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of
securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements).
Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities
portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily
used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements,
including the BTFP. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP as an
additional liquidity source, under which securities may be pledged at their
par value for a lending arrangement up to one year in length. Regions'
securities portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency
securities, MBS and corporate and other debt. In evaluating the liquidity
within the securities portfolio, "liquid securities free to use" are primarily
comprised of U.S Treasury securities and agency MBS. These highly liquid
securities include free to pledge securities as well as the incremental
borrowing availability under the BTFP, which is based on collateral values
being measured at par value under the program. Additionally, certain corporate
bonds are considered to be highly liquid. Additionally, other unencumbered
securities, primarily non-agency commercial MBS, serve as a source of
liquidity.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2023, Regions had
$2.0 billion in short-term FHLB borrowings and had additional borrowing
capacity from the FHLB, as shown in Table 21. FHLB borrowing capacity is
determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts that can be used in
collateral for future borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB
stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB
has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of
funding.

Regions has additional borrowing availability with the FRB through the
discount window as shown in Table 21. FRB borrowing capacity is determined
based on eligible loan amounts that can be used as collateral for future
borrowing capacity.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial
statements in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for

retirement of some instruments. See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash
sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other
cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at the holding company totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2023.
Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk
Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO
regularly review compliance with the established limits.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section
found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk
characteristics of each loan type. See further discussion of the current U.S.
economic environment in the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets"
section and counterparty risk below.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-
attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in
attempts to compromise or disable information systems. Such attempts have
increased in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue for a number
of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used
by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber-attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer
transactions. The related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new
cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies
on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and
although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security
capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase
exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses totaled $135
million during the first quarter of 2023 compared to a benefit from credit
losses of $36 million during the first quarter of 2022. Refer to the
"Allowance" section for further detail.

_______

NM - Not Meaningful

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, corporate analysis
service charges, non-sufficient fund fees, and other customer transaction-
related service charges. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, service
charges decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily as a result
of overdraft-related policy enhancements that eliminated non-sufficient fund
fees in mid-June 2022. An increase in fees from treasury management partially
offset the overall decline in service charges.

Capital Markets Income

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that
include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as
foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory
services. Capital markets income decreased in the three months ended March 31,
2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by negative
credit/debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movements. Partially
offsetting the negative valuation adjustments was an increase in M&A advisory
fees in the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due
to timing of transactions.

Mortgage Income

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of
residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage income in the
three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was due
primarily to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market
interest rates. Additionally, mortgage income for the three months ended March
31, 2022 included approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-
securitization and sale of Ginnie Mae loans previously repurchased from their
pools. Partially offsetting these declines in mortgage income was an increase
in mortgage servicing income, which overcame a decline in mortgage servicing
rights valuation and net hedges.

Investment Services Fee Income

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment
advisory services. Investment services fee income increased during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily
to the rising interest rate environment, which has driven increases in fixed
annuity rates and the related investment income. Also contributing was an
increase in assets under management due to an increase in financial advisors.

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of
market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits.
Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets decreased in the three
months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to market
volatility. The adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-
interest expense.

Securities Gains (Losses), net

Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's
asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt Securities" section and
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for more
information.

Other Miscellaneous Income

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing,
valuation adjustments to equity investments (other than the item listed
separately in Table 22 above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and
other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes
actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income decreased in the three months
ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a
decline in commercial loan and leasing related fee income, a decrease in SBIC
income, and a decline in other miscellaneous income.

Salaries and Employee Benefits

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation,
long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as
401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as,
expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and
employee benefits increased during the first three months of 2023 compared to
the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in base salaries
resulting from annual merit increases in the first quarter of 2023 compared to
the second quarter of 2022, higher benefit expenses and higher incentive
compensation. Full-time equivalent headcount increased from 19,723 at March
31, 2022 to 20,113 at March 31, 2023 further contributing to the increase in
salaries and employee benefits.

Credit/checkcard Expenses

Credit/checkcard expenses include credit and checkcard fraud and expenses.
Credit/checkcard expenses decreased in the first three months of 2023 compared
to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a debit card accrual in the first
quarter 2022 related to a previous matter that did not repeat.

FDIC Insurance Assessments

FDIC insurance assessments increased during in the first three months of 2023
compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher FDIC premium expenses
primarily resulting from a two basis point increase in the quarterly
assessment rate schedules charged to all financial institutions effective for
the first quarter of 2023 and, to a lesser degree, as a result of loan growth
and declining cash balances.

The FDIC has estimated losses resulting from recent large regional institution
failures, including the portion attributable to protection of uninsured
depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception. Federal law requires that any
losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund related to this action be repaid
by a special assessment on banks. While previous special assessments have been
allocated to larger institutions based on size, the FDIC has wide discretion
on how to levy the special assessments. Regions is unable to reasonably
estimate the impact or timing of recognition at this time.

Other Miscellaneous Expenses

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications,
postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses,
mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses and other costs (benefits)
related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses increased in
the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to
higher non-service based pension-related expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was
$177 million compared to $154 million for the three months ended March 31,
2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 22.4 percent and 21.9 percent,
respectively. See the "First Quarter Overview" for the Company's near-term
expectations for future tax rates.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance
income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the
effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but
are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain
leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and
changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the
effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

At March 31, 2023, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $720
million compared to $943 million at December 31, 2022. The change in the net
deferred tax was due primarily to the deferred tax impact of decreases in
unrealized losses on securities available for sale and derivative instruments
arising during the period.

Item 3\. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The information presented in the "Market Risk" section of Part 1, Item 2 is

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. During the quarter ended March
31, 2023, there were no changes in Regions' internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial reporting.
