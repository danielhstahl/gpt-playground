Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions
may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the
actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in
those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that
are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including
the scope and duration of the pandemic (including any resurgences), actions
taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and their
success, the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines, and the direct and
indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather
are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and
information available to, management at the time the statements are made.
Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various
risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to
inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such
statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but
are not limited to, those described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the global
economy, has and could continue to adversely affect our capital and liquidity
position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and
increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result
in lost revenue or additional expenses. The pandemic could also cause an
outflow of deposits, result in goodwill impairment charges and the impairment
of other financial and nonfinancial assets, and increase our cost of capital.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of changes in tax laws, including the effect of any future
interpretations of or amendments to Tax Reform, which may impact our earnings,
capital ratios and our ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as
changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by
applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of
the recent change in U.S. presidential administration and control of the U.S.
Congress, which could require us to change certain business practices,
increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us,
or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments,
must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with
applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements
and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our
ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our business.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our business such
as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other
service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of
operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act or
failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our business on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and impact of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of

Table of Contents

  

commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans
outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or
damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our
reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit
rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic
conditions that we are not able to predict.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our
liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial
institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other
adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all
information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a
complete presentation of financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items,
necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
have been included. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in
Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Debt securities with carrying values of $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion at
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, were pledged to secure
public funds, trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements. Included
within total pledged securities is approximately $24 million of encumbered
U.S. Treasury securities at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at March 31, 2021, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 129 at December 31, 2020, to 254 at March 31,
2021. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2020 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented
credit impairment as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and
it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the
positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at
maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale were immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating impairment,
management did not identify any positions where impairment was believed to
exist in either of the three months ended March 31, 2021or 2020.

Total consumer| 28,664 | | | 29,428 |  
Total loans, net of unearned income| $| 84,755 | | | $| 85,266 |  
  
During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, Regions purchased
approximately $261 million and $470 million in indirect-other consumer,
residential first mortgage and commercial and industrial loans from third
parties, respectively.

Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of
2019. The Company remains in the direct auto lending business.

Table of Contents

  

At March 31, 2021, $19.6 billion in securities and net eligible loans held by
Regions were pledged for potential borrowings from the FHLB. At March 31,
2021, an additional $17.7 billion in net eligible loans held by Regions were
pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance are sales-type and
direct financing leases totaling $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2021, with
related income of $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, for a description of the methodology.

As of March 31, 2021, Regions' total loans included $4.3 billion of PPP loans.
These loans are guaranteed by the Federal government and as the guarantee is
not separable from the loans, Regions recorded an immaterial allowance on
these loans.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, Regions decreased the allowance
by $225 million to $2.1 billion, which represents management's best estimate
of expected losses over the life of the portfolio. The decrease was due
primarily to improving credit metrics, improvement in macroeconomic conditions
and recent government stimulus programs. Macroeconomic factors utilized in the
CECL loss models include, but are not limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, HPI
and the S&P 500 index, with unemployment being the most significant
macroeconomic factor. Regions' models are sensitive to changes in the economic
scenarios. While the March 31, 2021 economic forecast includes a degree of
uncertainty around how long the COVID-19 pandemic will persist, the forecast
continues to exhibit improvement in the economic outlook. Risks to the
economic forecast and the model limitations are considered through model
adjustments and the qualitative framework.

The following tables present analyses of the allowance by portfolio segment
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate and consumer.
Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for information regarding Regions' portfolio segments
and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal
banking regulators' definitions and are utilized to develop the associated
allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for
information regarding commercial risk ratings.

Regions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique
credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices
and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio.
FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal
underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans.
Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for
various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an
updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop
the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less
probability of default and vice versa.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding the Company's
TDRs,including their impact on the allowance and designation of TDRs in
periods subsequent to the modification.

As provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed into law on December
27, 2020, which extended initial guidance provided in the CARES Act, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act relief and short-term nature of most
COVID-19 deferrals precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan
modifications from being classified as TDRs as of March 31, 2021 and December
31, 2020.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

(1)"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology
is a discounted net cash flow approach.

  

In the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased the rights to
service residential mortgage loans on a flow basis for approximately $11
million and $4 million, respectively.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| March 31  
| 2021| | 2020  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 34,212 | | | $| 33,787 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 10.2 | %| | 18.1 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (28)| | | $| (26)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (51)| | | $| (49)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 564| | 629 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (10)| | | $| (5)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (21)| | | $| (10)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.8 | %| | 4.2 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 289| | 278  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.5 | | | 27.4 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

Servicing related fees and other ancillary income| $| 24 | | | $| 25 | | | | |  
  
Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 11 for additional information.

The table below presents an analysis of commercial MSRs under the amortization
measurement method:

(1)"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns.

Regions periodically evaluates the commercial MSRs for impairment based on
fair value. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs was approximately
$91 million at March 31, 2021 and $81 million December 31, 2020.

(1)Dividends on all series of preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are
payable quarterly in arrears.

(2)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR
plus 3.536%.

(3)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to August 15, 2029, 5.700%, and (ii) for
each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029, three-month LIBOR plus
3.148%.

(4)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2025, 5.750%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2025, the five-year
treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date plus
5.426%.

All series of preferred stock have no stated maturity and redemption is solely
at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part,
after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, within 90
days following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series A preferred
stock or at any time following a regulatory capital treatment event for the
Series B, Series C, and Series D preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared a total of $23 million in cash dividends on
Series A, Series B and Series C preferred stock during both the first three
months of 2021 and 2020. The Board of Directors declared $5 million in cash
dividends on Series D preferred stock during the first three months of 2021.
Therefore, a total of $28 million in cash dividends on total preferred stock
was declared in the first three months of 2021 compared to the total of $23
million in cash dividends on total preferred stock declared in the first three
months of 2020, as the initial quarterly dividend for the Series D preferred
stock was declared in the third quarter of 2020.

In the event Series A, Series B, Series C, or Series D preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $113 million, $67 million, $10 million,
or $4 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $100 million of Series A preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and
approximately $13 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Approximately $52
million of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of
preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to
retained earnings, and approximately $15 million of related issuance costs
that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related
surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common
shareholders. Approximately $10 million of Series C issuance costs that were
recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be
recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders.
Approximately $4 million of Series D issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders.

On April 27, 2021 Regions launched a proposed public offering, which was
completed on May 4, 2021, for the issuance of $400 million in depositary
shares each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the
Company's 4.45% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E, par value
$1.00 per share ("Series E preferred stock"), with a liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share of Series E preferred stock (equivalent to $25.00 per
depositary share). Dividends will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
4.45% for each period beginning September 15, 2021. The net proceeds from the
issuance of the Series E preferred stock will be used to redeem all of the
outstanding shares of the Company's Series A preferred stock. On May 4, 2021,
Regions sent redemption notices to the holders of the Series A preferred
stock, which will result in the redemption on the dividend payment date on
June 15, 2021.

COMMON STOCK

Regions was not required to participate in the 2021 CCAR; the Company chose to
participate in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB. The
submission was made in April 2021 and the Company expects to receive the
results by June 30, 2021, with an effective date October 1, 2021.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
The Company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of 2021 or
throughout 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the second quarter of 2021. The
Federal Reserve has indicated these restrictions are expected to be lifted
beginning in the third quarter of 2021, subject to capital remaining above
required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR cycle.

Regions declared $0.155 per share in cash dividends for both the first quarter
of 2021 and 2020.

NOTE 6. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  

The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per common
share and diluted earnings per common share:

The effect from the assumed exercise of 3 million in stock options, restricted
stock units and awards and performance stock units for both the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, was not included in the above computations of
diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an
antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.

NOTE 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Regions' defined benefit pension plans cover certain employees as the pension
plans are closed to new entrants. The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a
non-qualified pension plan that provides certain senior executive officers
defined benefits in relation to their compensation.

Net periodic pension cost (credit) includes the following components:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | | | | |  
| | | | | | | | | | |  
| | | | | | | | | | |  
  
The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (credit) is recorded
in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

Regions' funding policy for the qualified plans is to contribute annually at
least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made no
contributions during the first three months of 2021.

Regions also provides other postretirement benefits, such as defined benefit
health care plans and life insurance plans, that cover certain retired
employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on
the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2021 or 2020.

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Includes accrued interest of $28 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively.

(3)Includes accrued interest of $9 million at March 31, 2021 and $12 million
at December 31, 2020.

(4)Estimated fair value includes premium of approximately $51 million as of
March 31, 2021 and $83 million as of December 31, 2020 to be amortized over
the remaining life. Approximately $29 million of the decrease since December
31, 2020 related to hedges that were terminated during the first quarter of
2021 and were not amortized into earnings as of the date of termination.

(5)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

(6)The gain amounts,which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or
reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other
derivative positions. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, financial
instruments posted of $24 million, for both periods, were not offset in the
consolidated balance sheets.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors. As of March 31, 2021, Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions through 2026.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company terminated $2.0
billion and $2.6 billion in notional of floor and swap hedges,
respectively.The following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated
cash flow hedges on AOCI. The balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI
will be amortized into earnings through 2025.

premium amortization on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months.
Included in this amount is $93 million in pre-tax net gains related to the
amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Regions had $894 million and $924
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
Regions had $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in total notional
amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market
from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale
commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage
income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and
corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans
are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2021 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2021 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of March 31, 2021 was approximately $520 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at March 31, 2021 and
2020 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were $95 million and $74 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $99 million and $74
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis:

(1)All following disclosures related to Level 3 recurring and non-recurring
assets do not include those deemed to be immaterial.

(2)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, variation margin collateral payments made or
received for derivatives that are centrally cleared are legally characterized
as settled. As such, these derivative assets and derivative liabilities and
the related variation margin collateral are presented on a net basis on the
balance sheet.

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated with the
intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the
changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also elected to measure certain commercial and industrial loans
held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively traded in the
secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for
substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation service that
is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans are traded in
the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject to variability
and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these loans held for
sale was immaterial at March 31, 2021.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. These changes in fair
value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion
of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit
risk.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior period was updated to reflect
these enhancements. In the first quarter of 2021, the net interest income
allocation methodology was enhanced. All net interest income including the FTP
offset, activities of the treasury function, securities portfolio and interest
rate risk activities is allocated to the three reporting segments.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Table of Contents

  

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |

| March 31, 2021| | December 31, 2020

Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 27 | | | 25 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 92 | | | 126 |  
  
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
March 31, 2021, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not
complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. As previously disclosed,
Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the CFPB into certain of
Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional inquiries will arise
from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries
could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or
enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material
effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments,
findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third for the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the
Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $4.6 billion and $4.5
billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability
related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $1.5 billion at both
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Company would be liable for this
amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the
Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral
underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of
settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not
representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The
estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a
liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was approximately $5
million at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 1 "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, for additional information.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in the Form 10-K. See Note 1 "Basis of
Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the
consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of this
discussion will be on the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2020 for the consolidated statements of income.
For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion will be
the balances as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 7 through 9 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At March 31, 2021, Regions operated 1,366 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment
Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

On February 27, 2020, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement
to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company
headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and
included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses.
Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. Regions' April 2021 baseline forecast
anticipates real GDP growth of 6.2 percent in 2021, 4.1 percent in 2022, and
2.3 percent in 2023. The April baseline forecast anticipates the level of real
GDP will return to the fourth quarter 2019 level, the last quarter free of the
effects of COVID-19, in the second quarter of 2021. While the downside risks
posed by the COVID-19 virus have not been eliminated, they nonetheless have
diminished with further progress on the vaccination front. Further reopening
of the economy and significant fiscal and monetary

support are expected to lead to notably rapid growth over coming quarters, but
it is anticipated that by year-end 2022 the economy will be on a path of
growth of around 2.0 percent that prevailed prior to the pandemic. As has been
the case over the past year, there remains a heightened degree of uncertainty
around economic forecasts being made at present.

There was a marked acceleration in the pace of economic activity in March
2021, as evidenced in the data on nonfarm employment, consumer spending,
residential construction, and personal income. The monthly surveys conducted
by the ISM show accelerating and broad-based expansions in the manufacturing
sector and the broad services sector; and in March, the ISM Manufacturing
Index reached its highest level since December 1983 and the ISM Non-
Manufacturing Index rose to its highest level on record. The acceleration in
the pace of economic activity in March in part reflects payback for activity
having been held down by unusually harsh winter weather in February, but also
reflects further reopening of the economy and the distribution of the bulk of
the third round of Economic Impact Payments of up to $1,400 per eligible
recipient.

The third round of Economic Impact Payments came on top of an already elevated
household saving rate. While there are questions as to whether, or to what
extent, consumer behavior and attitudes will have changed after the
experiences of the pandemic, it is nonetheless expected that coming months
will see a significant spike in consumer spending, particularly spending on
services, as further progress is made on the vaccination front and the economy
more fully reopens. Additional fiscal policy support will also contribute to a
faster pace of economic growth. While supply chain/logistics issues pose a
headwind, particularly for motor vehicle producers, the broad-based expansion
in the manufacturing sector is expected to continue over coming quarters, and
business investment spending will contribute to top-line real GDP growth.
Single family residential construction will also be additive to growth, but
the for-sale segment of the housing market remains plagued by notably low
inventories of homes, new and existing, for sale. Along with strong demand,
lean inventories have contributed to robust house price appreciation which, in
conjunction with higher mortgage interest rates, could weigh on affordability.
However, new home construction and sales are expected to contribute to top-
line real GDP growth.

Inflation is expected to accelerate further in the months ahead, reflecting
base effects, supply chain/logistics bottlenecks, and services prices
adjusting to the economy reopening, while further weakness in the U.S. dollar
could also add to inflation pressures. While base effects are obviously
transitory, it is unclear whether, or to what extent, inflation pressures will
be sustained, particularly to the point the FOMC would feel compelled to
respond. Still, to the extent inflation, and inflation expectations, rise over
coming quarters, that will be a source of upward pressure on longer-term
market interest rates, with added pressure stemming from larger government
budget deficits that will necessitate increased debt issuance. With the short
end of the yield curve well-anchored, persistent steepening of the yield curve
could at some point lead the FOMC to alter the composition of FRB asset
purchases, putting more emphasis on longer-dated assets and less emphasis on
shorter-dated assets. We expect no changes in the pace of FRB asset purchases
in 2021, nor do we anticipate any changes in the Fed funds rate target range
at least through 2022.

The Biden Administration's proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan is not
incorporated into the April baseline forecast, as at present there are no
final details on either the spending side or the tax side of the plan. Still,
expectations of the potential economic effects of the plan should be tempered
by the fact that spending would be phased in over an eight-year period and may
be at least partially offset by tax increases. As such, the net effect on GDP
growth in any single year over the 2022-2029 period could be relatively small.

In March 2021, many of the top depository states in the Regions footprint had
significantly lower unemployment rates than the U.S as a whole, which could
indicate a more accelerated economic recovery in these states. Furthermore,
parts of the Regions footprint, most notably Florida, that are traditionally
more reliant on travel and tourism will continue to benefit from further
reopening of the economy and increased mobility. However, Texas and Louisiana
have above-average exposure to energy, so these economies could be more prone
to lasting effects if the recovery does prove to be slower than is now
anticipated.

The continued signs of economic improvement, with consideration of uncertainty
inherent in the forecast, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating
the ACL as of March 31, 2021. See the "Allowance" section for further
information.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the
economic environment in which the Company operates. In the first quarter of
2021, the economic forecast continued to show signs of recovery. While some
uncertainty remains, the economic forecast shows a much more positive outlook
as the economy moves toward fully reopening. There are select areas where the
COVID-19 pandemic impacted first quarter conditions, as discussed below.
Regions expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic
conditions and the Company's financial results in future quarters.

While branch lobbies are open for business, Regions continues to keep measures
in place to ensure associate and customer safety, such as providing face
coverings for all associates and reducing occupancy levels to encourage social
distancing. Regions is in the process of implementing a phased approach to
return remote working associates to office locations. As of March 31, 2021,
approximately 90 percent of the Company's non-branch associates are working
remotely.

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company continued to offer financial
assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial hardships
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering special
COVID-related payment deferral or forbearance programs for the Company's
mortgage and home equity loan customers.

Regions' outstanding deferrals have declined 92 percent since the initial
relief provided in early 2020 from $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 to $437
million as of March 31, 2021. Of total outstanding deferrals, 61 percent are
related to residential mortgages that are government guaranteed. Of the loan
balances that have exited deferral, 96 percent were either current or less
than 30 days past due.

As a certified SBA lender, Regions experienced a slight increase in lending
activity in the first quarter of 2021 as the Company continued to assist
customers through the loan process under the PPP. Under this program, Regions
has approximately 45,900 loans outstanding totaling approximately $4.3 billion
as of March 31, 2021.

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the
Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has
ample sources of liquidity that include a stable deposit base, cash balances
held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank,
unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the
Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders'
Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. With additional
government stimulus and changes in customer behavior, combined with continued
enhancements to overdraft practices and transaction postings, the Company
estimates consumer service charges will remain 10 percent to 15 percent below
pre-pandemic levels. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail.

Supervisory Stress Test Update

During the third quarter of 2020, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement
for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0
percent. On April 21, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend for the
second quarter of 2021 of $0.155 per share, which was in compliance with the
Federal Reserve's SCB framework.

While Regions was not required to participate in the 2021 CCAR, the Company
chose to participate in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions'
SCB. The submission was made in April 2021 and the Company expects to receive
the results by June 30, 2021, with an effective date of October 1, 2021.

First Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $614 million,
or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $139
million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2020.

For the first quarter of 2021, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $1.0 billion, up $38 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.02 percent for the
first quarter of 2021 and 3.44 percent in the first quarter of 2020. The
increase in net interest income was primarily driven by decreases in deposit
costs and outstanding borrowings. Net interest margin was negatively impacted
by excess cash balances due to significant deposit growth. Refer to Table 20
"Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis" for further
details.

The benefit from credit losses totaled $142 million in the first quarter of
2021, as compared to a provision of $373 million during the first quarter of
2020. The current quarter benefit was primarily due to continuing improvement
in credit metrics, improvement in macroeconomic conditions and recent
government stimulus programs. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses"
section for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $83 million, or an annualized 0.40 percent of average
loans, in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $123 million, or an
annualized 0.59 percent for the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

The allowance was 2.44 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at March
31, 2021 compared to 2.69 percent at December 31, 2020. The decrease was
impacted by the factors discussed above. The allowance was 280 percent of
total non-performing loans at March 31, 2021 compared to 308 percent at
December 31, 2020. Total non-performing loans (excluding loans held for sale)
remained flat at 0.87 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at both
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit
Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $641 million for the first quarter of 2021, a $156
million increase from the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by higher mortgage and capital markets income and positive market
valuation adjustments on

employee benefit assets. The increases were partially offset by lower service
charges income. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $928 million in the first quarter of 2021, a
$92 million increase from the first quarter of 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefit expenses. See Table
25 "Non-Interest Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $180 million
compared to $42 million for the same period in 2020. See "Income Taxes" toward
the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this report for
more detail.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $7.0 billion from year-end
2020 to March 31, 2021, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with
the FRB. Excess liquidity from deposit growth is held at the FRB. Deposit
growth was primarily driven by consumer deposits from recent government
stimulus payments during the first quarter of 2021. See the "Liquidity" and
"Deposits" sections for more information.

DEBT SECURITIES

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including
both available for sale and held to maturity:

| $| 28,151 | | | $| 28,276 | | | |  
  
Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated

financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Debt securities decreased $125 million from December 31, 2020 to March 31,
2021. The decrease from year-end was primarily the result of a reduction in
net unrealized gains due to an increase in market interest rates.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021, consisting of $1.2
billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $316 million of commercial
mortgage and other loans, and $8 million of non-performing loans. At December
31, 2020, loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion
of residential real estate mortgage loans, $460 million of commercial mortgage
and other loans, and $6 million of non-performing loans. In the fourth quarter
of 2020, Regions made the decision to sell a certain portfolio of $239 million
commercial and industrial loans, which were reclassified to held for sale as
of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, these loans remain in the held for
sale portfolio. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage
loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be
sold fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third
parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 64 percent of
Regions' interest-earning assets at March 31, 2021. The following table
presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and
class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2020 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to
Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding Regions'
portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

Many classes within Regions' portfolio segments continue to experience the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are
ultimately impacted will be influenced by the duration and severity of the
economic impact, the timely distribution and efficacy of a vaccine, as well as
the effectiveness of various government stimulus programs in place to support
individuals and businesses. See Table 3 and Table 4 below for more detail.

Table of Contents

  

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $371 million since year-end 2020. The March 31,
2021 balance includes $4.3 billion of PPP loans, an increase of $700 million
compared to year-end 2020. Although commercial and industrial loans increased
modestly, line utilization levels continued to decline to historically low
levels since year-end driven by continued excess liquidity and customer
deleveraging.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations.
Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to
commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

________

(1)"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

  

Regions has identified certain industry sectors within the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to
COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the first quarter of 2021, which
narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to year-end 2020. As of March 31,
2021, these high-risk industries include energy, healthcare, consumer services
and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Identified COVID-19 high-risk
balances have declined $1.8 billion from $5.2 billion at year-end 2020 to $3.4
billion as of March 30, 2021.

Industries and sub-sectors identified as high-risk may change in future
periods depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over
time. These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within
these industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. PPP loan balances are not
included in Table 4 as these loans are not considered high risk, as they are
fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. Regions is closely monitoring
customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers.
All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless
specifically identified as IRE.

_______

(1)Represents balances considered high-risk that are not included in COVID-19
high-risk industries

(2)Regions defines classified loans as commercial and investor real estate
loans risk-rated substandard accrual and non-accrual, and criticized loans as
those risk-rated special mention, substandard accrual and non-accrual.
Criticized loans are also referred to as "criticized and classified".

Of the COVID-19 high-risk industries and sub-sectors noted in the table above,
Regions considers certain ones worthy of further discussion as described
below. The period over period trends in the credit metrics such as percent
criticized and the leveraged percent of balance as illustrated in Table 4 are
indicators of a higher level of risk in those industries and sub-sectors.

Regions' direct energy portfolio is comprised mostly of E&P and midstream
sector borrowers. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of high-risk
energy loans declined compared to December 31, 2020 levels. The outstanding
balance of criticized loans in this category also decreased and there were no
leveraged loans included within the direct energy portfolio at March 31, 2021.
During the first three months of 2021, Regions recognized a nominal amount of
energy charge-offs. Furthermore, oil prices rebounded from all-time lows in
April 2020 returning to pre-pandemic levels and hedge positions are strong for
oil producers and natural gas providers.

Full service restaurant lending remains a focus as areas of the economy begin
to reopen. Regions' exposure in restaurant lending identified as high risk
continued to decline as outstanding balances decreased $54 million from year-
end 2020. The balance of criticized loans in the high-risk restaurant lending
portfolio also decreased as compared to December 31, 2020. During the three
months ended March 31 2021, Regions recognized gross restaurant charge-offs of
$3 million.

Regions' hotel-related portfolio is primarily comprised of 11 REIT customers.
These loans are unsecured commercial and industrial loans; however, they are
real estate related. The REIT portfolio benefits from low leverage, strong
liquidity, and diversity of property holdings. Regions' exposure in hotel-
related lending identified as high risk increased by $8 million compared to
December 31, 2020, however the balance of retail-related IRE loans identified
as high risk decreased significantly.| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans decreased $41 million in comparison to 2020 year-
end balances.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans

  

55

Table of Contents

  

increased $68 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances. The increase in
residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an increase in
originations due to continued historically low market interest rates.
Approximately $1.5 billion in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the first three months of 2021.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $253 million in comparison to 2020 year-end
balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions'
branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home
equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment
upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity.
The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments required
until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March
31, 2021. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a
balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a
repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans
decreased by $82 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which was lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio decreased $166 million from year-end 2020 as
Regions has discontinued its indirect auto lending business. The Company
remains in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through
third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio decreased $169
million from year-end 2020 due to exiting a third party relationship during
the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $102 million from
year-end 2020 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as well as
elevated payment rates.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $60 million from year-
end 2020.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" .

Table of Contents

  

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Discussion of the methodology
used to calculate the allowance is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, as well as related discussion in Management's
Discussion and Analysis.

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to
external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by
changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate
demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health
pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural
disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

The allowance totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $2.3 billion
at December 31, 2020, which represents management's best estimate of expected
losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers
of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 7 below. While many of
these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most
relevant.

_______

(1)Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and
recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a
reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets in the
first quarter of 2020.

(2)This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-
off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans.. This line
item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2021,
which are fully backed by the U.S. government and have an immaterial
associated allowance.

  

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views of credit metrics, trends and industry outlooks, as well
as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The first
quarter of 2021 exhibited continued signs of improvement, as evidenced by a
modest improvement in almost all credit metrics. Commercial and investor real
estate criticized balances decreased approximately $44 million, total net
charge-offs decreased $11 million, and non-performing loans, excluding held
for sale, decreased approximately $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of
2020. Conversely, classified balances increased $144 million compared to the
fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well and
the HPI showed robust appreciation. Regions continued to perform a bottom-up
review of loan portfolios during the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in
fewer sectors considered high-risk compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As
of March 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of commercial and investor real estate loans
are in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments, a decline of $1.8 billion from
December 31, 2020. These high-risk industries include energy, healthcare,
consumer services and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Refer to the
"Portfolio Characteristics" section for more information about the high-risk
industries. As the credit risk within Regions' loan portfolio continues to be
evaluated, both negative and positive factors of the ever-evolving economic
landscape were considered in determining the allowance estimate.

As economic activity accelerated and additional fiscal and monetary policy
moved through the system, the first quarter of 2021 showed signs of economic
improvement, evidenced by higher consumer spend in the current quarter. While
economic growth continued to improve, the public health crisis is not resolved
and economic uncertainty still remains. Regions' economic forecast utilized in
the March 31, 2021 allowance estimate considered the continued improvement of
the economic outlook, the economy reopening further and increased distribution
of vaccines. Refer to the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking

Furthermore, Regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts
and external data available.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of March 31, 2021. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment remained normalized in the first quarter as noted above.

| 4,091  
  
All of these factors, along with credit improvement described above, were
significant drivers of the modeled decreases in the allowance. While Regions'
quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any
estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of
imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component
which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in
any modeling estimate. The March 31, 2021 general imprecision allowance
reflected management's caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the
allowance given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery as
the changing status of the pandemic unfolds.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$2.1 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of March 31, 2021.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates,
unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well
as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the CARES
Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net
charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the
remainder of 2021 and beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. As provided initially in the CARES Act
passed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision of both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required
guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the
disclosures below.

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments
are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. Upon expiration of the
deferral period, customers may apply for additional relief or resume making
payments on their loans. Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on
the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower. The TDR relief and short-
term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded these modifications from
being classified as TDRs as of March 31, 2021.

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other
consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and
investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal
program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a
workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real
estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate
is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market.
Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information
is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan
balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the
periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but
not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed
loans excluded were $51 million at March 31, 2021 and $57 million at December
31, 2020.

Non-performing loans at March 31, 2021 have decreased compared to year-end
levels, primarily driven by a slight decline in commercial investor real
estate.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and
is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit),
at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more
often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting
unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2020 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and
the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit).

The result of the assessment performed for the first quarter of 2021 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions' reporting units for
the March 31, 2021 interim period.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service
and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers.
Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality
banking services and the Company's digital channels and contact center.

The following table summarizes deposits by category:

Table 15--Deposits

Corporate treasury time deposits| 2 | | | 11 | | |  
| | | | |  
| $| 129,602 | | | $| 122,479 | | |  
  
Total deposits at March 31, 2021 increased approximately $7.1 billion compared
to year-end 2020 levels, driven by increases in non-interest-bearing demand,
savings, interest-bearing transaction and domestic money market categories.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer time deposits.
Increases across all categories are primarily driven by an increase in
customer deposit balances due to recent government stimulus payments and, to a
lesser degree, new account growth. Also contributing to non-interest bearing
demand growth is an increase in deposits from business customers who continued
to retain excess liquidity. Customer time deposits decreased due to
maturities, and continued lower interest rates resulted in a decrease in the
utilization of time deposit accounts.

On January 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the
redemption on January 22, 2021, of its 3.20% senior notes due February 2021
pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of
100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On February 19, 2021, Regions Bank sent notices of redemption, which resulted
in the redemption on March 1, 2021 of its 2.75% senior bank notes due April 1,
2021 and of its senior floating rate bank notes due April 1, 2021 pursuant to
their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The Ascentium note securitizations have various classes and have a weighted-
average interest rate of 2.12% at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
with remaining maturities ranging from 3 years to 5 years and a weighted-
average of 3.8 years.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $17.9 billion at March 31, 2021 as compared to $18.1
billion at December 31, 2020. During the first three months of 2021, net
income increased shareholders' equity by $642 million, cash dividends on
common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $149 million and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced shareholder's equity by $28 million. Changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased shareholders' equity by $723
million, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on
securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of
changes in market interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2021.
The derivative instruments are hedges designed to protect net interest income
in a low short-term interest rate environment, such as the one that currently
exists.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to
Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking
agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is
included in the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business"
section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory
Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2020
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13
"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated
financial statements in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At
March 31, 2021, the impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $528
million, or approximately 50 basis points.

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory requirements:

In October of 2020, the SCB framework that was finalized in the first quarter
of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk
sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help
determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5
percent to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result
of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital
Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5 percent in addition to the minimum
risk-weighted asset ratios shown above.

During the third quarter of 2020, and in connection with the results of its
supervisory stress test released in June 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized
Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third
quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the
amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario,
inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. In December
2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed the results of its supervisory stress test
associated with the capital plan resubmission. While the Federal Reserve did
not recalibrate SCBs as a part of the resubmission for participating banks,
Regions' implied SCB would have been floored at 2.5 percent based on capital
degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario had the SCB been
updated. The decision to update SCB requirements based on the resubmission
results was initially deferred to March 31, 2021 and subsequently deferred
again to June 30, 2021. As such, the Federal Reserve may decide at any point
through June 30, 2021 to update Regions' and other firms' SCB requirement
based on the results. Additionally, Regions chose to participate in 2021 CCAR
in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB. The submission
was made in April 2021 and the Company expects to receive the results by June
30, 2021, with an effective date October 1, 2021.

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential
standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters
related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under
these rules.

  

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2020 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its

letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial
condition and liquidity. See the "Risk Factors" section in the 2020 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for more information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average balances of loans", "adjusted ending
balances of loans", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted net
interest margin", "adjusted efficiency ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio",
"return on average tangible common shareholders' equity" on a consolidated
operations basis, and end of period "tangible common shareholders' equity",
and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain
other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a
meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes
will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and
predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used
by management to assess the performance of Regions' business because
management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be
indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these
non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of
the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and
the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Average total loans and ending total loans are presented excluding loan
balances related to loans originated through the SBA's PPP program, the
indirect-other consumer exit portfolio and the indirect-vehicles exit
portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP) and adjusted
ending total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average and ending
total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and
presents them on the same basis as that applied by management.

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to
loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss
allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government, are excluded from total loans and the related credit loss is
excluded from the total allowance for credit losses.

Net interest margin is presented excluding the impact of SBA PPP loans and
excess cash, defined as cash exceeding $750 million. Regions believes the
adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) provides investors with meaningful
additional information about Regions' performance when margin associated with
the SBA's PPP loans and excess cash are excluded from net interest margin
(GAAP).

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are
added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted
efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common shareholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common shareholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common shareholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans
(GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of
ending total loans (GAAP) to adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), a
reconciliation of ACL (GAAP) to ACL excluding PPP loans' ACL (non-GAAP), and a
computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 4) a
reconciliation of net interest margin (GAAP) to adjusted net interest margin
(non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available
to common shareholders (GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest expense
(GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of net
interest income, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest
income, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of non-
interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 10) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 11) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), and 12) a reconciliation of average and ending
shareholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

The increase in net interest income for the first quarter 2021 compared to the
same period in 2020 was driven by declines in deposit costs, combined with
decreases in outstanding borrowings and FHLB advances as a part of Regions'
active cash management strategy. The decline in interest expense was partially
offset by a decline in interest income on loans which was aided in the first
quarter of 2021 by increases in loan balances and fee income attributable to
PPP lending, the Company's April

2020 acquisition of Ascentium Capital LLC, and increased production of
residential first mortgage loans. Additionally, the Company's hedging strategy
became active in the first quarter of 2020, with benefits expanding as more
notional became active throughout 2020, which also contributed to the increase
in net interest income. The hedges had a positive impact of approximately $102
million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $9 million in the first
quarter of 2020.

The decline in net interest margin for the first quarter 2021, compared to the
same period in 2020, was primarily driven by elevated liquidity as indicated
by higher cash balances, increases in loan balances due to PPP lending and
loan production at lower market interest rates. Additionally, net interest
margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios
and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates. Excluding the
impact of PPP lending and excess cash, which Regions considers to be balances
in excess of $750 million, adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) for the
first quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 declined modestly to
3.40%. See Table 19 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of
adjusted net interest margin.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all
rates fall to levels consistent with historical minimums. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of March 31, 2021, Regions was asset
sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as
compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending March
2022.

The first quarter of 2021 continued the trend of strong growth in low-cost
deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. Retention of these
balance sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and much of the recent deposit
growth is expected to be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario.
Therefore, additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-related "surge"
deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in Table 21.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. Net interest income sensitivity to short-term
rates is approximately neutral when excluding pandemic-related deposit
increases. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the
Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1-month LIBOR)
will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such
rates higher or lower. Under that environment, it is expected that changes in
funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the
change in asset yields. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge" deposits
with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for
further net interest income growth.

Net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors. While this
was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it also represents
a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve steepens. An
increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to
longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher
on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective
yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of
premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The
opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest
rates fall.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 21 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the
behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is
uncertain. Therefore, Table 21 includes two balance sheet scenarios to help
inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an opportunity scenario,
and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable, legacy balances,
which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second is a reduction
scenario that assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate,
requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the
bank. For this scenario, "surge" deposits are assumed to be all balance growth
on legacy accounts from February 2020 to March 2021, or roughly $27.5 billion.
These deposits, including non-interest bearing, are attributed with a 75%
repricing beta in rising rate scenarios.

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels
is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case
scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 21, interest-bearing deposit
rates move into the single digits. The deposit beta model is dynamic across
both interest rate level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100
basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate 20% to
25% interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the "surge"
deposit interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario,assuming
legacy betas and a 75% beta, respectively. Deposit pricing outperformance or
underperformance of 5% in that scenario would increase or decrease net
interest income by approximately $28 million, respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from
non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of
the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3.0 billion over 12
months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 21.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding
hedges is disclosed in Table 22 and its accompanying description. Importantly,
outstanding receive-fixed cash flow hedges begin to mature in late 2022. While
those maturities are outside of the 12-month horizon of the analysis outlined
in Table 21, the hedge maturity profile will begin to add asset sensitivity at
a time when markets currently expect the FOMC to begin to increase short-term
interest rates. Regions expects to maintain a persistent amount of hedges
through time to support a consistent, sustainable earnings profile and will
adjust outstanding derivatives depending on changing market dynamics and the
balance sheet mix.

(5)The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12-month average rate
shock where all rates are floored at historical lows observed during the
pandemic.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
equal to the historical all-time minimum. Further, the scenarios presented do
not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 21 above
quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under
this environment.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a
predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are
executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives
to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its
mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the
origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the
potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect
the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in
interest rates and pricing.

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

(1)Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination
of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1-month LIBOR.

As of March 31, 2021, the entire $21.8 billion notional of the cash flow
hedging relationships designated in Table 22 above were active. Total cash
flow hedges have a current weighted average maturity of approximately 3.6
years. During the first quarter of 2021, Regions shortened a portion of its
future hedge exposure to balance its future interest rate risk needs with the
evolving macro-economic environment. Notional of $2.3 billion swaps maturing
in August of 2023 were terminated and replaced shorter maturity swaps. An
additional $2.25 billion swaps and floors were terminated and replaced with
shorter maturity swaps. The net impact was a reduction of $2 billion of
floors, mostly maturing in January 2025, and an addition of $2

billion of swaps, mostly maturing in December 2022. Subsequent to March 31,
2021, through May 3, 2021, Regions terminated $1.750 billion of swaps maturing
in 2025, which were replaced with shorter maturity swaps.

Importantly, the gain on unwound hedges is deferred and amortized into net
interest income over the life of the original hedge, creating no change in the
expected net interest income profile under market forward interest rates.
These changes and the resulting hedge maturity profile allow for an increasing
asset sensitive balance sheet position at a time when the FOMC seems more
likely to move short-term rates higher.

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts outstanding at
each year-end period.

(1)All cash flow hedges active within the 12-month measurement horizon are
included in the income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 21.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives
traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains more
information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of
these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of
Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty
credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 8 "Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements
for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-end derivatives positions and
further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use
after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or
2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31. 2021.
Existing contracts referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated
no later than June 30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by
the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative
products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use
LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in
settings other than 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a
LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with
all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this
program, the Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks
associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks
associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR
Steering Committee. Regions is

following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates and is
operationally ready to offer new benchmarks as they are adopted by regulatory
agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

As of March 31, 2021, Regions had approximately $33.3 billion of total
outstanding commercial and investor real estate loans and $1.2 billion of
total consumer loans that reference LIBOR. Regions also has securities within
its investment portfolio of $475 million that reference LIBOR. Furthermore,
Regions' Series B and C preferred stock reference LIBOR when their dividend
rate begins to float after 2023 and had total carrying values of $433 million
and $490 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2021.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. Regions' goal in liquidity management is to
satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the
same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs in normal and stressed
conditions. As discussed below, Regions has a variety of liquidity sources,
which it may utilize to fund customer needs. Having and using various sources
of liquidity to satisfy the Company's funding requirements is important.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are
funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders' equity. Regions
also has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note
11 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional discussion of the Company's funding requirements.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt
Securities"to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various
secured borrowing capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions'
liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base.
Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money
markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured
sources of funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At March 31, 2021, Regions
had approximately $23.0 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase
from approximately $16.4 billion at December 31, 2020, which has continued to
be impacted by deposits associated with government programs offered in
relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for
more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of March 31, 2021, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $13.3 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2021, Regions had
no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $15.4 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledges certain
securities and loans as collateral, which comprise its FHLB borrowing
capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required based on
membership and in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB
has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of
funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress
testing to maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity and to provide
for liquidity risks. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to
maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service
and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and
cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.3 billion at March 31,
2021. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its
Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and
ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits.

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the
economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the
establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the
PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its
customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending
institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company
through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.
As of March 31, 2021, Regions has not used the Paycheck Protection Program
Liquidity Facility.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber
attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, which have
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by
us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from
outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment
has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations
and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of
its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and
monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions'
reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The benefit from credit losses totaled $142 million
in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a provision for credit losses of $373
million during the first quarter of 2020. Refer to the "Allowance" section for
further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges. The decrease during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the
same period of 2020 was the result of lower consumer spending. The impact of
COVID-19 hit late in the first quarter of 2020; and as such, part of the
quarter was free from impact. Overall customer spending behaviors have
changed, which combined with enhancements to overdraft practices and
transaction posting procedures, are expected to keep service charges ten to
fifteen percent below pre-pandemic levels. See the "First Quarter Overview"
section for further detail.

Card and ATM fees--Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit
card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. In the first
quarter of 2021, card and ATM fees had recovered to pre-pandemic levels,
primarily driven by debit card spending and transaction volumes. Although
discretionary spend is recovering, credit card spend remains slightly behind
prior year levels.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage
income in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was
due to increased loan production and sales income as lower interest rates
drove higher loan application volume.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. The increase in the first quarter of 2021
compared to the same period of 2020 was primarily driven by increases in
positive market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to credit
derivatives within commercial swap income, fees generated from the placement
of permanent financing for real estate, securities underwriting and placement
fees, and M&A advisory services.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustment reported
as employee benefit assets - other is offset in salaries and benefits. Changes
in market valuation adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 were driven by the
overall performance of the equity markets.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check
fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of

  

79

Table of Contents

  

affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and
any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the
first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 due to increases in commercial loan
related fee income and SBIC income.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased during the first
quarter of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020, driven primarily by
higher 401(k) expenses as a result of positive market valuation adjustments on
employee benefit assets and higher production-based incentives. Offsetting
these increases, full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 18,926 at March
31, 2021 from 19,743 at March 31, 2020, reflecting the continuing impact of
the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic
priorities which offset the addition of 401 associates from the April 2020
equipment finance acquisition.

Equipment and software expense--Equipment and software expense includes
depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of
equipment and software (software is rented and internally developed) utilized
by Regions and its affiliates. Equipment and software expense increased during
the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, driven
primarily by software rental expense and depreciation.

Outside services--Outside services consists of expenses related to routine
services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs,
data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data
subscriptions, and check printing. Outside services decreased during the first
quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to Regions
exiting a third party lending relationship.

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses--Professional, legal and
regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other
professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory
expenses increased primarily due to elevated legal and consulting costs.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses
and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other
miscellaneous expenses increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to
the same period in 2020 primarily due to increases in digital banking
expenses, operational losses, and other

  

80

Table of Contents

  

miscellaneous expenses. Offsetting these increases were lower expenses
associated with limited travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was
$180 million compared to $42 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.9 percent and 20.6 percent,
respectively. The Company expects the full-year tax rate to be approximately
22 percent for 2021.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance,
tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax
rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not
consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged
leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to
unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax
rate between periods may be impacted.

At March 31, 2021, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $344
million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $505 million at December
31, 2020. The decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily due to
the decrease in unrealized gains on available for sale securities and
derivative instruments.

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance
company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to
increase business loans and leases to small business customers using
Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities.

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of
assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired,
$1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial
and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were
long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of
the borrowings, and as of March 31, 2021, $81 million of long-term debt
remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair value.

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on
the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered
to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price
less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is
recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition,
which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related
to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset
value as part of the acquisition.

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value
mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the
contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The
amortization will not be material.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of
$348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. Purchase accounting
adjustments of $16 million reduced goodwill during the measurement period.
Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other
intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life
of each recognized asset.

Item 3\. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Reference is made to pages 75 through 79 included in Management's Discussion
and Analysis.

Item 4\. Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,
under the supervision and with the participation of Regions' management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Regions'
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. During the quarter ended March
31, 2021, there have been no changes in Regions' internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial reporting.
