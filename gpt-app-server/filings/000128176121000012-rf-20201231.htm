PART I

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions
may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the
actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in
those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that
are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including
the scope and duration of the pandemic (including any resurgences), actions
taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and their
success, the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines, and the direct and
indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather
are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and
information available to, management at the time the statements are made.
Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various
risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to
inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such
statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but
are not limited to, the risks identified in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and those described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the global
economy, has and could continue to adversely affect our capital and liquidity
position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and
increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result
in lost revenue or additional expenses. The pandemic could also cause an
outflow of deposits, result in goodwill impairment charges and the impairment
of other financial and nonfinancial assets, and increase our cost of capital.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of changes in tax laws, including the effect of any future
interpretations of or amendments to Tax Reform, which may impact our earnings,
capital ratios and our ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

Supervision and Regulation

We are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and
their subsidiaries. This framework is intended primarily for the protection of
depositors, the FDIC's DIF and the banking system as a whole, and generally is
not intended for the protection of shareholders or other investors. Described
below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to
us and our subsidiaries. These descriptions are not intended to be complete
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the
statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation,
and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other
governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Overview

We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a BHC and have elected to be
treated as an FHC under the BHC Act. As such, we and our subsidiaries are
subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC
Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Generally, the BHC Act
provides for "umbrella" regulation of FHCs by the Federal Reserve and
functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory
agencies. The BHC Act also requires the Federal Reserve to examine any
subsidiary of a BHC, other than a depository institution, engaged in
activities permissible for a depository institution. The Federal Reserve is
also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of,
examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company subsidiary.

Regions Bank is a member of the FDIC, and, as such, its deposits are insured
by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. Regions Bank is an Alabama state-
chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Its operations are
generally subject to supervision and examination by both the Federal Reserve
and the Alabama State Banking Department and the bank regulators are given
authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the
establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The federal and state
banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or
development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.
State and federal laws and regulations govern the activities in which Regions
Bank engages, including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of
loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance
laws and regulations also affect its operations. Regions Bank is also affected
by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it implements monetary policy. As a
Federal Reserve System member bank, Regions Bank is required to hold stock in
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in an amount equal to 6 percent of its
capital stock and surplus. Member banks with total assets in excess of $10
billion, including Regions Bank, receive a floating dividend rate tied to
10-year U.S. Treasuries, with the maximum dividend rate capped at 6 percent.

Regions Bank and its affiliates are also subject to supervision, regulation,
examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection
laws and regulations. Some of Regions' non-bank subsidiaries are also subject
to regulation by various federal and state agencies, such as the SEC and FINRA
in the case of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Regions Securities LLC and
BlackArch Securities LLC.

We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Our
common stock and certain of our depository shares representing our outstanding
preferred stock are listed on the NYSE. Consequently, we are also subject to
the NYSE's rules for listed companies.

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and the other Federal bank regulators
finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential
standards and capital and liquidity regulations to BHCs and depository
institutions per the EGRRCPA amendments (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring
Rules assign each U.S. BHC with $100 billion or more in total consolidated
assets, as well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on
its size and five other risk-based indicators: (1) cross-jurisdictional
activity, (2) wSTWF, (3) non-bank assets, (4) off-balance sheet exposure, and
(5) status as a U.S. G-SIB.

Under the Tailoring Rules, Regions and Regions Bank are each subject to
Category IV standards, which apply to banking organizations with at least $100
billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds
specified for Categories I through III. Firms subject to Category IV standards
are generally subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms
with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, but are, among other
things, subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and also required to
monitor and report certain risk-based indicators. Accordingly, under the
Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms are, among other things, (1) not subject to
LCR requirements (or, in certain cases, subject to reduced requirements), (2)
no longer subject to company-run capital stress testing requirements, (3)
subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial instead of annual
basis, (4) subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on
an annual basis and (5) subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk
committee requirements.

Regions cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws, regulations and
regulatory agency policies, including any changes resulting from the recent
change in U.S. presidential administration, yet such changes may have a
material impact on Regions' business, financial condition or results of
operations. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and
any new regulations promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and
fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB
and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.

Permissible Activities under the BHC Act

In general, the BHC Act limits the activities permissible for BHCs to the
business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities
as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as
to be properly incidental thereto. A BHC electing to be treated as a FHC, like
Regions, may also engage in a range of activities that are (i) financial in
nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a
financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and
soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally.
These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making,
insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance
company portfolio investments.

For a BHC to be eligible to elect FHC status, all of its subsidiary insured
depository institutions must be well-capitalized and well-managed as described
below under "-Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA" and must have received at
least a satisfactory rating on such institution's most recent examination
under the CRA. The BHC itself must also be well-capitalized and well-managed
in order to be eligible to elect FHC status. If an FHC fails to continue to be
well-capitalized or well-managed after engaging in activities not permissible
for BHCs that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies,
the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply
with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does
not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the
company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to
discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities
permissible only for a BHC electing to be treated as an FHC. Furthermore, if
the Federal Reserve determines that an FHC has not maintained a CRA rating of
at least "satisfactory," the FHC would not be able to commence any new
financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities,
although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely
related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting
banking activities.

The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible non-banking
activities of BHCs. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any BHC or its
subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or
control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to
believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control
constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of
any bank subsidiary of the BHC.

Capital Requirements

Regions and Regions Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital
adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the
Basel III framework.

The Basel III-based U.S. capital rules, among other things, impose a capital
measure called Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, or CET1 capital, to which most
deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made. In
addition, the Basel III-based U.S. capital rules specify that Tier 1 capital
consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting certain
specified requirements.

Under the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules, the minimum capital ratios are:

•4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets;

•6.0% tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) to
risk-weighted assets;

•8.0% total capital (that is, tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) to risk-
weighted assets; and

•4.0% tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under
U.S. Basel III Standardized approach (known as the "leverage ratio").

The U.S. capital rules previously imposed a CCB of 2.5% on top of the three
minimum risk-weighted asset ratios listed above for all banking organizations
subject to the rule. On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve approved a final
rule designed to create a single, integrated capital requirement by combining
the quantitative assessment of the capital plans of BHCs with $100 billion or
more in total consolidated assets, such as Regions, with the CCB requirement.
Details of this final rule are discussed under "\- Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review and Stress Testing" below.

Regions and Regions Bank are subject to the final rule adopted by the Federal
Reserve, OCC and FDIC in July 2019 relating to simplifications of the capital
rules applicable to non-advanced approaches banking organizations. These rules
became effective for the Company on April 1, 2020, and provide for simplified
capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage
servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that
a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry
backs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial
institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory
capital.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as
the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the
standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these
standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk
(including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements
for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as unused credit
card and home equity lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach
for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will
generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor
phasing in through January 1, 2028. Under the current U.S. Basel III rules,
operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to
advanced approaches institutions, and not to Regions or Regions Bank. The
impact of Basel IV will depend on the manner in which it is implemented in the
U.S. with respect to firms such as Regions and Regions Bank.

For more information, see the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Item 7\.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Leverage Requirements

BHCs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage capital
requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total consolidated average tangible assets (as defined for regulatory
purposes), called the "leverage ratio," of 4.0% for all BHCs.

Liquidity Requirements

Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in
wSTWF, including Regions and Regions Bank, are no longer subject to an LCR
requirement or the recently finalized NSFR requirement. However, BHCs that are
Category IV firms remain subject to minimum liquidity buffers and liquidity
stress testing requirements under the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential
standards, though the minimum frequency of such testing was revised to
quarterly under the Tailoring Rules, rather than monthly. The Tailoring Rules
also adjusted liquidity risk management requirements such that Category IV
firms are required to: (i) calculate collateral positions monthly (as opposed
to weekly); (ii) establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than
was previously required; and (iii) monitor fewer elements of intraday
liquidity risk exposures. Category IV firms are required to continue reporting
liquidity data on the FR 2052a on a monthly basis.

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Stress Testing

The Federal Reserve currently conducts analyses of BHCs with at least $100
billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the firms have
sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in
baseline and severely adverse economic conditions. Under the Tailoring Rules,
Category IV firms, including Regions, are now subject to supervisory stress
testing every other year, rather than annually, and are no longer subject to
company-run stress testing requirements, but remain subject to required annual
capital plan submissions and to certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements.

U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as
Regions, must annually develop and maintain a capital plan, and must submit
the capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR
process. The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that these BHCs have
robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each
company's unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of
economic and financial stress. On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve
finalized a rule that further tailors the capital planning requirements
applicable to Category IV firms.

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule designed to create
a single, integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative
assessment of CCAR with the CCB requirement. The final rule replaces the
current static 2.5 percent CCB with an SCB requirement. The SCB reflects
capital degradation in the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve's
supervisory stress tests and also includes four quarters of planned common
stock dividends. The SCB is, however, subject to a minimum of 2.5 percent. In
addition, the final rule eliminates the quantitative objection provisions of
CCAR but requires a BHC to reduce its planned capital distributions if those
distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer
constraints based on the BHC's own baseline scenario projections. On August
10, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that Regions' initial SCB would be 3.0
percent. Although the final rule replaces the static CCB requirement with one
based on the results of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests, firms
continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital
actions as they approach the minimum ratios. Banking institutions that fail to
meet the effective minimum ratios once the SCB is taken into account will be
subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share
repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The extent to
which capital distributions will be constrained depends on the amount of the
shortfall and the institution's "eligible retained income" (which is defined
under an August 2020 final rule as the greater of (1) a banking institution's
net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions
to shareholders and associated tax effects not already reflected in net
income, and (2) the average of a banking institution's net income over the
preceding four quarters). For further information, see the "Regulatory
Requirements" section of Item 7\. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

As part of the January 19, 2021 final rule discussed above, the Federal
Reserve finalized revisions to the SCB requirements that are applicable to
Category IV BHCs to align with the two-year supervisory stress testing cycle
for Category

13

Table of Contents

  

  

  

IV BHCs. Under the final rule, for Category IV BHCs, the portion of the SCB
requirement that reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse
scenario of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests is calculated every
other year. During a year in which a Category IV BHC does not undergo a
supervisory stress test, the BHC will receive an updated SCB requirement that
reflects the BHC's updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV BHC
is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year
in which the BHC would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test
and consequently receive an updated SCB requirement.

Under the March 4, 2020 final rule implementing the SCB, a BHC must receive
prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital
distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital
instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. The Federal
Reserve announced on June 25, 2020 that all BHCs participating in CCAR would
be required to update and resubmit their capital plans in light of the
economic uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the
Federal Reserve announced that for the third quarter of 2020 it would
generally require those BHCs to suspend share repurchases, limit common stock
dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020, and limit
common stock dividend payments to an amount based on average net income for
the four preceding quarters. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve
extended these measures for the fourth quarter of 2020.

In conjunction with the release of the results from the Federal Reserve's
review of capital plan resubmissions and a second round of stress testing, the
Federal Reserve announced on December 18, 2020 that it would extend the
distribution limitations to the first quarter of 2021, subject to adjustment,
requiring that common stock dividend payments and share repurchases be limited
to an amount not in excess of average net income over the four preceding
quarters, provided that common stock dividend payments remain limited to the
amount paid in the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve did not
initially adjust SCBs based on the results of the second round of stress
testing, but maintained the right to do so through March 31, 2021.

Resolution Planning

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by EGRRCPA, certain BHCs are
required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing
for the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of
its material financial distress or failure. However, in connection with the
release of the Tailoring Rules, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized rules
in October 2019 which, among other things, adjust the review cycles and
applicability of the agencies' resolution planning requirements. Under these
new rules, Category IV firms such as Regions are no longer required to submit
resolution plans. In April 2019, the FDIC released an advance notice of
proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning
requirements for insured depository institutions, such as Regions Bank. In
January 2021, the FDIC announced that, given the passage of time from the last
resolution plan submissions and the uncertain economic outlook, the FDIC will
resume requiring resolution plan submissions for insured depository
institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, including Regions Bank. The
FDIC indicated that no insured depository institution will be required to
submit a resolution plan without at least 12 months advance notice, but did
not otherwise provide notice of when Regions Bank will be required to submit
its next resolution plan.

Safety and Soundness Standards

The FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective
action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified
capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories ("well-
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized"), and the federal banking
agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized
to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically
undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary
supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution
is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the
banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that
is critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2020, both Regions and
Regions Bank were well-capitalized.

An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital
levels may be treated as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is
adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may
be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly
undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound
condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an
acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking
regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be
accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that
a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration
plan, subject to certain limitations. The BHC must also provide appropriate
assurances of performance.

The FDIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-
capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations
and management, asset quality, and executive compensation and permits
regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such
standards. Regulators also must take into consideration: (i) concentrations

of credit risk; (ii) interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of
an institution's assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or
its off-balance sheet position); and (iii) risks from non-traditional
activities, as well as an institution's ability to manage those risks, when
determining the adequacy of an institution's capital. Regulators make this
evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institution's safety
and soundness. Additionally, regulators may choose to examine other factors in
order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

Payment of Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other
subsidiaries. The principal source of cash flow to us, including cash flow to
pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on any of our
outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and
regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as
well as by us to our shareholders.

If, in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency, an institution under
its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound
practice, such agency may require, after notice and hearing, that such
institution cease and desist from such practice. The federal bank regulatory
agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's
capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking
practice. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay a dividend if
payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is
undercapitalized. See "-Safety and Soundness Standards" above. Moreover, the
Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that BHCs
and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating
earnings.

Payment of Dividends by Regions Bank. Under the Federal Reserve's Regulation
H, Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or
pay a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar
year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank's net income for that year and (b)
its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any
required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the
retirement of preferred stock.

Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90% of its
net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least 20% of capital. Regions
Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama
Superintendent of Banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of
all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the
total of (a) Regions Bank's net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained
net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus. The statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings
from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and
other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating
expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all
federal, state and local taxes. Regions Bank cannot, without approval from the
Federal Reserve and the Alabama Superintendent of Banking, declare or pay a
dividend to Regions unless Regions Bank is able to satisfy the criteria
discussed above.

Payment of Dividends by Regions. Our payment of dividends to our shareholders
is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. In particular, the
dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC, such as Regions, are
reviewed by the Federal Reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of
the CCAR process and stress tests as submitted by the BHC. As discussed above,
the Federal Reserve has limited dividend payments and share repurchases for
the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 in
response to the economic uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. See
"-Capital Requirements" and "-Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and
Stress Testing" above.

Support of Subsidiary Banks

Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy, which has been codified by the
Dodd-Frank Act, Regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength
to, and to commit resources to support, its subsidiary bank. This support may
be required at times when Regions may not be inclined to provide it. In
addition, any capital loans by a BHC to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such
subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC's bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC
to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary
bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
payment.

Transactions with Affiliates

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's
Regulation W restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates,
including a parent BHC. Regions Bank is subject to these restrictions, which
include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of
transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to
affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of
assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These
restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be
collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or
better for the bank. Generally, a bank's covered transactions with any
affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank's capital stock and surplus and
covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank's
capital stock and surplus.

Deposit Insurance

Regions Bank accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC
insurance up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits
may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository
institution has

15

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition
to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule,
order or condition imposed by a bank's federal regulatory agency.

Regions Bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on an
assessment rate established by the FDIC. FDIC assessment rates for large
institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as Regions Bank, are
calculated based on a "scorecard" methodology that seeks to capture both the
probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude
of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs, based
primarily on the institution's assessment base, which is primarily the
difference between average total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC
has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or
down, based upon significant risk factors that may not be adequately captured
in the scorecard. For large institutions, including Regions Bank, after
accounting for potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate
that is applied to an institution's calculated assessment base could range
from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis.

For more information, see the "FDIC Insurance Assessments" section of Item 7\.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions

The BHC Act requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal
Reserve before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of
any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such
acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of
the voting shares of the institution; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries,
other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any
bank or savings and loan association; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate
with any other BHC. FHCs must obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve
before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding
$10 billion. FHCs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be well-
capitalized and well-managed.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any
transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any
combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business
of banking in any section of the U.S., or the effect of which may be
substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any
section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of
trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are
clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs
of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to
consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the
BHCs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be
served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital
adequacy, and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to
be served includes the parties' performance under the CRA. The Federal Reserve
must also take into account the institutions' effectiveness in combating money
laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act was
amended to require the Federal Reserve to, when evaluating a proposed
transaction, consider the extent to which the transaction would result in
greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or
financial system.

Depositor Preference

Under federal law, claims of depositors and certain claims for both
administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured
depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general
unsecured claims against such an institution in the "liquidation or other
resolution" of such an institution by any receiver.

Volcker Rule

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in
proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain
relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds
that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the Volcker
Rule. The final rules implementing the Volcker Rule also require that large
BHCs, such as Regions, design and implement compliance programs to ensure
adherence to the Volcker Rule's prohibitions. Development and monitoring of
the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and
management attention. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, CFTC
and SEC finalized rules to tailor the application of the Volcker Rule based on
the size and scope of a banking entity's trading activities and to clarify and
amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. On June 25, 2020,
these regulators approved a final rule with respect to the implementing
regulations relating to covered funds, including changes to the definition of
"covered fund" and the prohibitions on certain covered transactions.

Consumer Protection Laws

We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws,
including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various
sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited
to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth
in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act,
and their respective state law counterparts.

The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under
various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws
referenced above, other fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB
also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to
consumer financial laws for depository institutions with $10 billion or more
in assets, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive
practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.

Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of
banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information
about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require
disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-
affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is
used in diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In
addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among
affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a
product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and
application information. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and
other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and
experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or
services.

The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding
cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among
financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish
multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes
address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial
institution's management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to
effectively respond and recover the institution's operations after a cyber-
attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate
processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical
service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack.
The Regions Information Security Program reflects the requirements of this
guidance.

In addition, on December 18, 2020, the federal banking regulators proposed a
new cybersecurity-related notification rule that would require banking
organizations, including Regions and Regions Bank, to notify their primary
federal regulator promptly of the occurrence of certain significant computer-
security incidents. The proposed rule would also impose requirements on bank
service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of
certain computer-security incidents.

State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy
and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have
adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement
cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to
these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also
recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data
privacy requirements. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became
effective on January 1, 2020, and in November 2020, California voters approved
the California Privacy Rights Act. We expect this trend of state-level
activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring
developments in the states in which our customers are located.

Community Reinvestment Act

Regions Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
CRA, Regions Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with
safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its communities,
including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. The CRA requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory
agency, in connection with its examination of a depository institution, to
assess such institution's record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of
the community served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment is part of the Federal
Reserve's consideration of applications by a bank or BHC to acquire, merge or
consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to
establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an
office. In the case of a BHC applicant, the Federal Reserve will assess the
records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant BHC, and
such records may be the basis for denying the application. In April 2018, the
U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking
regulators with recommended changes to the CRA's implementing regulations to
reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. Subsequently, in
December 2019, the OCC and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking
intended to update and modernize the CRA's implementing regulations. On May
20, 2020, the OCC finalized its rule while the FDIC, which had joined the
OCC's proposed rulemaking, did not proceed with a final rule. The Federal
Reserve, which did not join the OCC and FDIC's proposal, in October 2020 put
forth its own advance notice of proposed rulemaking focused on CRA
modernization. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the
regulations implementing the CRA. Regions Bank's most recent CRA rating from
the Federal Reserve is "Satisfactory".

Compensation Practices

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve.
The federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that
incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account
risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth
the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation
arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives
that appropriately balance risk and

17

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose
their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be
compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the
arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance
provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will
be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization's supervisory ratings,
which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions.
The guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a
banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related
risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the
organization's safety and soundness.

Anti-Money Laundering

A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in
recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The
USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations
to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers,
investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of
the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title
III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions,
including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program
that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations
regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an
account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned
accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money
laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure
of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act's requirements
could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Regions' banking subsidiary has augmented its systems and procedures to meet
the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update
their policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA
PATRIOT Act and implementing regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires
federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in
combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank
acquisition. In January 2021, the AMLA, which amends the BSA, was enacted. The
AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money
laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach
to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the
development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating
technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement-
and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the
available sanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of the statutory
provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemaking, reports and other
measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things,
rulemaking and implementation guidance.

FinCEN, which drafts regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act and other
anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act legislation, has adopted rules that
require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with
respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business,
subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing
their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to
monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance
programs.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with
designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known
as the "OFAC" rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury
Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions
targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they
contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with
or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct
or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions
on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making
investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a
sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or
specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by
prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including
property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g.,
property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or
transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with
these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Regulation of Broker Dealers and Investment Advisers

Our subsidiaries, Regions Securities LLC and BlackArch Securities LLC, are
registered broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA, and Regions Investment
Management, Inc. and Highland Associates, Inc. are registered investment
advisers with the SEC. These subsidiaries are, as a result, subject to
regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory
organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including
capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and
securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping
and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material
non-public information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and
limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition
to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration
of certain broker-dealers and investment advisers.

Competition

All aspects of our business are highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete
with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate
and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in major financial centers
and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations,
credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance
companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and
financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. We
expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies given
the low interest rate and slower economic environment. Also, future changes in
monetary policy, coupled with post-crisis regulatory requirements, may
increase competition for certain deposit products. Our success will depend, in
part, on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and
services. Further, we expect consolidation in the financial services industry
to continue, which may produce larger, better-capitalized and more
geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of
financial products and services at competitive prices. In addition, technology
has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer
traditional bank or bank-like products and services and therefore compete with
financial institutions like us in providing electronic, internet-based, and
mobile phone-based financial solutions. In particular, the activity of
fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue
to grow. A number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been
granted, bank or industrial loan charters, while other fintechs have partnered
with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their
customers. In addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have
begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their
customers. Although providing digital products and services has been important
to serving customers and competing in the financial services industry for some
time, the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the move towards digital
banking and financial services, and we expect a bank's digital offerings to be
a key competitive differentiator beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The move toward
digital banking and financial services, and customer expectations regarding
digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in
technological improvements. Customers for banking services and other financial
services offered by our subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience,
quality of service, price of service, personal contacts, the quality of the
technology that supports the customer experience, and availability of
products. Although our position varies in different markets, we believe that
our affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in
their relevant market areas.

Human Capital

One pillar of our strategic priorities at Regions is the commitment to "Build
the Best Team". We believe one of the biggest differentiators of our
performance is the people we employ. The need to attract, retain, and develop
the right talent to accomplish our strategic plan is central to our success.
As of December 31, 2020, Regions and its subsidiaries had 19,406 full-time
equivalent employees supporting our consumer and commercial banking, wealth
management, and mortgage product and services primarily across the Southeast
and Midwest.

Our associate team reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.
Approximately 64 percent of our associates are women and approximately 34
percent have self-identified as a part of a minority demographic. Because
diversity equity and inclusion are fundamental to our human capital strategy,
we believe it is important for our stakeholders to understand our progress,
and therefore, we plan to provide additional transparency into our workforce
demographics later this year after we file our 2019 and 2020 EEO-1 report to
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

A strong and impactful human capital programs begins at the top. Our Board of
Directors oversees our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture,
values and high ethical standards, and through its Committees, holds
management accountable for results. Beginning in 2018, the Board expanded the
scope of our CHR Committee beyond its traditional compensation focused role to
include oversight of all human capital management efforts within Regions.
Since this expansion, the CHR Committee has strategically conducted reviews of
talent management and acquisition, succession planning, associate conduct,
associate learning and development, diversity equity and inclusion, and
associate retention. Notably, in 2019, the CHR Committee further strengthened
its oversight of these areas through the implementation of a HCM Dashboard
that it reviews periodically throughout the year. The HCM Dashboard includes a
mixture of trending and point-in-time metrics designed to provide information
and analysis of workforce demographics; talent acquisition; workforce
stability (retention, turnover, etc.); associate engagement; learning and
development; and total rewards and associate support program utilization and
effectiveness.

In order to build the best team, it is necessary for us to fill talent needs
with qualified, diverse and engaged associates. Key to our success is our
internal talent management program which strives to optimally deploy existing
talent across Regions by focusing on where our associates excel and helping
them find the best roles for them. One of the hallmarks of our success in this
area is demonstrated by our ability to fill vacancies from within. For
example, in 2020, 45 percent of our hires were internal fills. For those roles
which we fill externally, we continually build talent pipelines with an eye
towards not only current needs, but also future demands of our business.
Regions uses a number of innovative tools and structured processes to achieve
our goals including applications and resources designed to reach larger and
more diverse audiences. Our recruiting technology is agile, user friendly and
allows us to offer to candidates a robust understanding of our needs,
requirements and a view of our culture to support the building of a diverse,
engaged workforce.

Diversity equity and inclusion are fundamental to our corporate strategy. Our
commitment to diversity and inclusion as noted starts at the top of our
organization, with oversight of our initiatives provided by the CHR Committee.
Led by our executive level Chief DE&I Officer, this commitment is implemented
by a dedicated DE&I team, reinforced by senior leaders, and supported by our
outstanding management team and associates. We track our progress in this area
and continually implement programs and practices to support managers in
reaching our goals.

We also consider it critical to our success to invest in the professional
development of all of our associates. We emphasize our commitment to
professional development through opportunities such as technical, skills-
based, management, and leadership training programs; formal talent and
performance management processes; and sustainable career paths. We also aim to
prepare our workforce for a rapidly changing environment and understand that
reskilling and upskilling are crucial to staying competitive, meeting the
needs of the modern workforce, and retaining associates. We've established a
customized learning experience platform that provides the tools to measure,
build, and communicate skills inside the Company. This tool provides the
ability to inventory the skills our associates have, allowing us to target our
development efforts on specific areas where elevated skills are needed.
Regions also offers a leader and manager development program created to help
people managers understand how to evaluate performance by leveraging the power
of a strengths-based and engagement-focused workforce and culture.

Understanding that automation, cognitive technologies, and the open talent
economy are reshaping the future of work, Regions makes available to
technology associates courses on-demand that offer intensive learning in
application development, information technology operations, security, and
technology architecture. This solution also offers professional development
for data and business professionals. In addition, almost all associates may
access a full suite of courses regardless of whether the application is needed
in their current role.

We offer competitive and fair compensation to our associates. Base salaries
are established considering market competitive rates for specific roles;
additionally, on an individual basis base salaries reflect the experience and
performance levels of our associates. We assess the competitiveness of our
ranges on an annual basis by benchmarking our rates against those paid by our
peers. We established a minimum starting rate for our entry level positions at
$15 an hour and we continue to study and review that level to ensure
appropriateness. In addition to base salaries, we promote a robust pay for
performance philosophy and incentivize a large majority of our associate
population with incentive compensation designed to drive strategies, behaviors
and business goals within our unique lines of business. Long-term stock-based
incentive compensation is also key to the attraction and retention of key
talent and is offered thoughtfully to our executive and leadership ranks. We
believe tying the interests of our leaders to those of our shareholders
creates a strong link to company performance.

As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of
our associates, we offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits program to
support associates throughout all life stages. Our benefits include
comprehensive health, life, and disability coverage that are funded in whole
or in part by the Company as well as a 401(k) plan with a dollar for dollar
company match on employee contributions up to 5 percent of pay and a base
contribution of 2 percent of pay for all associates who do not participate in
our grandfathered pension program. We also offer to our associates programs
and tools to support their total well-being including a range of flexible work
arrangements, generous time-off policies, physical, mental, and financial
wellness benefits as well as other programs and practices that support
associates and their families throughout the full spectrum of their careers
and lives.

Finally, in any review of 2020 human capital programs, it is imperative to
note responsive changes we made in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. During
2020 we implemented changes and enhancements that we determined were in the
best interests of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve.
For example, in an effort to promote associate well-being, we quickly moved
approximately half of our associates to fully remote work arrangements during
the pandemic. For those associates whose positions required on site service
(such as branch, contact center and other operationally essential positions),
we provided additional compensation during the original transition period to
aid with unexpected and unusual conditions faced by these individual as we
responded to the in-person service needs of our customers and communities. In
addition, we implemented many other measures to help ensure and support
associate safety. These measures included providing COVID-19 testing and
relevant treatment at no cost to associates, expanding access to and payment
for telehealth benefits and offering enhanced leave of absence benefits for
those dealing with the virus or quarantine requirements. In all of our
locations, we reduced occupancy levels to provide for social distancing,
implemented stringent cleaning protocols, and have provided appropriate
facemasks and other sanitizing supplies to protect associates, customers, and
our communities.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risks, some of which, including market,
liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic
risks, could be substantial and is inherent in our business. These risks also
includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease
considerably, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment
could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below are risk factors that could
adversely affect our financial results and condition, as well as the value of,
and return on investment in the Company.

Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business

Our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

We provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as
well as other financial services including asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and
other specialty financing. All of our businesses are materially affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the Southeastern U.S., the principal markets in which we
conduct business. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have
adverse effects on our business, including the following:

•A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other
products and services offered by us;

•A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by
consumer or commercial real estate;

•An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;

•A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in
interest rates; and

•An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become
delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their
loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses, and
valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

In the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can
be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would
intervene. Further, the ultimate success of measures taken in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown, and these measures may not be sufficient to
address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or avert severe and prolonged
reductions in economic activity. If economic conditions worsen or volatility
increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially adversely affected.

Our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of
operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions that have adversely affected,
and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial
condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. We cannot predict the
extent to which the pandemic will continue to cause such adverse effects. The
extent of any continued or future adverse effects will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including
the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our
employees, clients, customers, counterparties and service providers, as well
as other market participants. Circumstances brought about by the pandemic
persist, including worsened economic conditions, increased market volatility,
ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults, reductions in the
targeted federal funds rate, and increased spending on business continuity
efforts, which may require that we reduce costs and investments in other
areas. Should the pandemic continue for a more extended period or worsen, we
may face additional circumstances such as significant draws on credit lines
should customers seek to increase liquidity.

We are offering assistance to support customers experiencing financial
hardships related to the pandemic. If such measures are not effective in
mitigating the effects of the pandemic on borrowers, we may experience higher
rates of default and increased credit losses in the future. We may also have
to provide additional assistance or otherwise experience higher rates of
default and increased credit losses. Further, we have approximately $3.6
billion in PPP loans as of year-end 2020, and have provided additional PPP
loans, including second draw loans, in 2021. These efforts may affect our
revenue and results of operations and make our results more difficult to
forecast as the PPP forgiveness process has begun and the timing and amount of
forgiveness to which our borrowers will be entitled is unpredictable. In
addition, the PPP and other government programs in which we may participate
are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and regulatory
scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to our reputation.

Certain industries where Regions has credit exposure, including energy,
restaurants, hotels, and commercial retail, have experienced, and in some
cases are continuing to experience, significant operational challenges as a
result of the COVID-19

21

pandemic. These operational challenges could result in corporate lending
clients making higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit, which
may negatively affect our liquidity. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may
also cause our commercial customers to be unable to pay their loans as they
come due or decrease the value of collateral, which we expect would cause
significant increases in our credit losses. The pandemic may alter consumer
behavior, including short- and long-term spending patterns. Accordingly,
certain of these industries may continue to be negatively impacted even after
the pandemic has subsided.

Other negative effects of the pandemic that may impact our business, financial
condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at
this time, but it is likely that such adverse effects will continue until the
COVID-19 pandemic subsides and the U.S. economy fully recovers. The COVID-19
pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks
described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form
10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Until the COVID-19
pandemic subsides, we expect reduced revenues from our lending businesses,
increased credit losses in our lending portfolios and a decrease in certain
sources of fee income. Additionally, draws on lines of credit could increase
in the future. After the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, it is possible that the
U.S. economy experiences a prolonged recession, which we expect would
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity,
capital and results of operations.

Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results
and condition.

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business.
We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer
deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come
due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and
unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market
stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our
activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors
that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy
generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity
sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and
operations are concentrated, difficult credit markets, or unforeseen outflows
of cash or collateral, including as a result of higher than usual draws on
credit lines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our access to deposits may
also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a
majority of our liabilities during 2020 were checking accounts and other
liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days' notice,
while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were loans, which
cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically
been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not
be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of
our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A
failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., and adverse changes
in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our financial
results and condition.

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., particularly in the
states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and
Texas. As a result, local economic conditions in the Southeastern U.S.
significantly affect the demand for the loans and other products we offer to
our customers (including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the
ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral
securing these loans. Although real estate values in many geographies have
improved since the financial crisis, future declines, including any due to the
current economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely
affect borrowers and the value of the collateral securing many of our loans,
which could adversely affect our currently performing loans, leading to future
delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses.
Further or continued adverse changes in these economic conditions could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Weather-related events and other natural disasters, including those caused or
exacerbated by climate change, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a
disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse
impact on financial results and condition. Higher focus on climate change can
also bring transition risks, which can negatively impact some sectors and
borrowers in our loan portfolio.

A significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the
Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, regions that are susceptible to
hurricanes, or in areas of the Southeastern U.S. that are susceptible to
tornadoes and other severe weather events. In particular, in recent years, a
number of severe hurricanes impacted areas in our footprint. Many areas in the
Southeastern U.S. have also experienced severe droughts and floods in recent
years. Any of these, or any other severe weather event, could cause disruption
to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall
business, results of operations or financial condition. We have taken certain
preemptive measures that we believe will mitigate these adverse effects, such
as maintaining insurance that includes coverage for resultant losses and
expenses; however, such measures cannot prevent the disruption that a
catastrophic earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or other severe weather
event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse
impact on our customers, such as hindering our borrowers' ability to timely
repay their loans and diminishing the value of any collateral held by us. The
severity and impact of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes,
droughts, floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and
may be exacerbated by

22

global climate change. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the
Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean, such as oil spills, could have similar
effects.

Climate change may worsen the frequency and severity of future earthquakes,
fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other extreme weather-
related events that could cause disruption to our business and operations.
Chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also
cause disruption to our business and operations. Climate change may also
result in new and/or more stringent regulatory requirements for the Company,
which could materially affect the Company's results of operations by requiring
the Company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations
related to climate change that may be forthcoming. New regulations, shift in
customer behaviors or breakthrough technologies that accelerate the transition
to a lower carbon economy may negatively affect certain sectors and borrowers
in our loan portfolio, impacting their ability to timely repay their loans or
decreasing the value of any collateral held by us.

We are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could
adversely affect our reputation and the trading price of our common stock.

We are subject to a variety of risks that arise out of the set of concerns
that together comprise what have become commonly known as ESG matters. Risks
arising from ESG-related policies and practices may adversely affect, among
other things, our reputation and the trading price of our common stock.

As a large financial institution with a diverse base of customers, vendors and
suppliers, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of
those we choose to do business with and the public's (or certain segments of
the public's) view of those entities. This negative publicity may be driven by
adverse news coverage in traditional media and may also be spread through the
use of social media platforms. If Regions' relationships with its customers,
vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity,
our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively
impacted and the trading price of our common stock may also be impacted.

Additionally, investors are considering how corporations are incorporating ESG
considerations into their business strategy when making investment decisions.
For example, investors are more widely beginning to incorporate the business
risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies' responses to climate
change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. These shifts
in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of
our common stock if investors determine that Regions has not made sufficient
progress on ESG matters.

If we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than
anticipated, our earnings may be materially adversely affected.

As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to
repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral
securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure
repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan
portfolio and provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of
factors. Our management periodically determines the allowance for credit
losses based on available information, including the quality of the loan
portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual
loans, taking into account relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions that affect the collectability of our loan portfolio. Increases in
the allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing our
reported net income. If, as a result of general economic conditions, there is
a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio and management
determines that additional increases in the allowance for credit losses are
necessary, we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income,
and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

Although our management will establish an allowance for credit losses it
believes is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the life of
loans in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. For example,
if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal
markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate
unexpectedly, additional credit losses not incorporated in the existing
allowance for credit losses may occur. Losses in excess of the existing
allowance for credit losses will reduce our net income and could adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps
materially.

In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance
for credit losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and to real
estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us
to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

As discussed in greater detail below, CECL became effective January 1, 2020,
and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other
financial assets. The accounting standard removes the existing "probable"
threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies
to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial
assets. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
disclosure on the impact to the allowance at adoption.

Weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our
performance.

As of December 31, 2020, consumer residential real estate loans represented
approximately 27.9% of our total loan portfolio. Declines in home values would
adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate
that we hold, as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we
realize on the sale of real estate loans. These factors could result in higher
delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our
performance.

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 8.5% of our loan portfolio consisted of
investor real estate loans. The properties securing income-producing investor
real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the
loan. The borrower's ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon
additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower's successful
operation of a business. Weak economic conditions, including those caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lockdowns or required business closings
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may impair a borrower's business operations
and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may
also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy
rates for retail, office and industrial space may increase, and hotel
occupancy rates may decline. High vacancy and lower occupancy rates could also
result in rents falling. The combination of these factors could result in
deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market
and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. Any such deterioration
could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due
under their loans. As a result, our business, results of operations or
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien
position could materially adversely affect our performance.

Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien
position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a
higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes
both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $7.3 billion home equity
portfolio at December 31, 2020, approximately $4.6 billion were home equity
lines of credit and $2.7 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily
originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a
first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to
borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time
of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in
addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of
potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk
because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the
collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien
position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $2.3
billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position.

Weakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance.

Many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly
impacted by changes in commodity prices. This includes agriculture, livestock,
metals, timber, textiles and energy businesses (including oil, gas and
petrochemical), as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities
prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment
used in production of commodities. Changes in commodity products prices depend
on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and
demand for the relevant commodity. These industries have been, and may in the
future be, subject to significant volatility. For example, oil prices have
been volatile in recent years, including in 2020, and commodity prices have
generally declined as a result of reduced demand driven by the COVID-19
pandemic. As a consequence of oil and gas price volatility, our energy-related
portfolio may be subject to additional pressure on credit quality metrics
including past due, criticized, and non-performing loans, as well as net
charge-offs. In addition, legislative changes such as the elimination of
certain tax incentives could have significant impacts on this portfolio.

Industry competition may adversely affect our degree of success.

Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate
in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a
result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as
continued industry consolidation. This consolidation may produce larger,
better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable
of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more
competitive prices. For example, there have been a number of recently
completed or announced significant mergers of financial institutions within
our market areas, and there may in the future be additional consolidation.
These mergers will, if completed, allow the merged financial institutions to
benefit from cost savings and shared resources.

In our market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings
and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, fintechs, finance
companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking
firms, mortgage companies, and other financial intermediaries that offer
similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same
extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in
competing for business.

In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for
non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services,
that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology
companies to

24

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based,
and mobile phone-based financial solutions. Competition with non-banks,
including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is
intensifying. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly
over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may
continue to offer bank or bank-like products. For example, a number of
fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been granted, bank or industrial
loan charters. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks
to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Regulatory
changes, such as the revisions to the FDIC's rules on brokered deposits
intended to reflect recent technological changes and innovations, may also
make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products.
In addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have begun to make
efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and
are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so. Many of these
companies, including our competitors, have fewer regulatory constraints, and
some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical locations.
Although providing digital products and services has been important to serving
customers and competing in the financial services industry for some time, the
COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the move toward digital banking and
financial services and we expect a bank's digital offerings to be a key
competitive differentiator beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The move toward
digital banking and financial services, and customer expectations regarding
digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in
technological improvements.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of additional factors,
including customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, the
quality of the technology that supports the customer experience, pricing and
range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers
and to retain our current customers, our business, financial condition or
results of operations may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In
particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our
customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial
stability, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other
sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands,
thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin and financial performance.
In addition, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven
products and services or be successful in marketing these products and
services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to
retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial
condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.

Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which
is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning
assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense
incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits
and borrowings). Net interest income also includes rental income and
depreciation expense associated with operating leases for which Regions is the
lessor. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the
average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-
bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the
cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and
mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in
turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local economy, competition
for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC and interest rates
markets.

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based
on short-term interest rates, the level of which is influenced heavily by the
FOMC's actions. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are
typically driven by both short-term and longer-term interest rates. Longer-
term rates are affected by multiple factors including the actions of the FOMC
through actions such as quantitative easing or tightening, and the market's
expectations for future inflation, growth and other economic considerations.
The level of net interest income is, therefore, influenced by the overall
level of interest rates along with the shape of the yield curve. Interest rate
volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our
portfolios. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase
at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, our
net interest income may decline. Our net interest income would be similarly
affected if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a
faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.

The significant reductions to the federal funds rate have led to a decrease in
the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities. If interest rates decline
further, we would expect net interest income to decline, however the Company's
interest rate hedging program will protect against any reductions to short
term interest rates.

Conversely, an increasing rate environment would likely have a positive impact
on twelve-month net interest income. However, increasing rates would also
increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely
affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated and could
result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our results of operations
and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. The overall
effect of lower interest rates cannot be predicted at this time and depends on
future actions the Federal Reserve may take, including in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting economic conditions.

For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies
for these risks, see the "Net Interest Income, Margin and Interest Rate Risk,"
"Net Interest Income and Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and
"Securities" sections of Item 7\. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates
are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the
products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine
their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark
rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket or other financial
metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent
national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for
reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the FCA announced that the FCA
intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the
calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed
extending publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to
June 30, 2023 and ceasing publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31,
2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly
encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a
reference rate in "new" contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by
December 31, 2021. These actions and announcements indicate that the
continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed
after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether
and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the
calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR
will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or
rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any
such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked
financial instruments.

Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative
Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended
fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified
recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates, and proposed implementations
of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. For example, in
April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York commenced publication of the
SOFR, which has been recommended as an alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR by the
Alternative Reference Rates Committee. However, uncertainty remains as to the
transition process and acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR.
At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and
proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and
what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-
rate financial instruments.

Certain of our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but
not limited to, hedging products, debt obligations, preferred stock,
investments, and loans, extend beyond proposed LIBOR cessation timelines. We
are in the process of assessing the impact that a cessation or market
replacement of LIBOR would have on these various products and contracts.

Any future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and
place limitations on business activities.

The major ratings agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based
on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions
affecting the financial services industry generally. In general, ratings
agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors,
including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level
and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit
ratings. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to
change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take
action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future. Additionally,
ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies
and practices, which may affect our credit ratings. In the future, changes to
existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may, among other
things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in
which we have an economic interest.

Regions' credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our
ability to access the debt and capital markets, as well as reduce our
profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances. If Regions
were to be downgraded below investment grade, we may not be able to reliably
access the short-term unsecured funding markets, and certain customers could
be prohibited from placing deposits with Regions Bank, which could cause us to
hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our ongoing liquidity needs.
Such actions could reduce our profitability as these liquid investments earn a
lower return than other assets, such as loans. Regions' liquidity policy
requires that the holding company maintain the greater of (i) cash sufficient
to cover 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (ii) a cash balance
of $500 million. Although this policy helps protect us against the costs of
unexpected adverse funding environments, we cannot guarantee that this policy
will be sufficient.

Additionally, if Regions were to be downgraded to below investment grade,
certain counterparty contracts may be required to be renegotiated or require
posting of additional collateral. Refer to Note 21 "Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fair value of contracts subject to
contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such
contracts. Although the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown, it
is reasonable to conclude that Regions may be required to post additional
collateral related to existing contracts with contingent credit features.

The value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the
future.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $5.2 billion of goodwill and $122 million of
other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash
flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic
growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common
stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of

26

* * *

the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the
future related to the impairment of our goodwill. The COVID-19 pandemic may
impact our assessment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions and increases
in income tax rates could also have a material impact on assessments of
goodwill for impairment. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of
our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit
intangibles, purchased credit card relationship assets, and the DUS license.
Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these
intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of
credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition and adverse
changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed
unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating
results and regulatory capital ratios.

As of December 31, 2020, Regions had approximately $505 million in net
deferred tax liabilities, which include approximately $785 million of deferred
tax assets (net of valuation allowance of $31 million). Our deferred tax
assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that
they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this
determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available,
including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable
temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. We have determined
that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at
December 31, 2020 (except for $31 million related to state deferred tax assets
for which we have established a valuation allowance). If we were to conclude
that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely
than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely
affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital
ratios. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities
would be affected by a change in statutory tax rates. An increase in statutory
rates would have an adverse effect on a net deferred tax liability position.
Other tax law changes could have a detrimental impact on the value of deferred
tax assets.

Changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely
affect us.

Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading,
clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many
different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions
with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and
dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even mere speculation
about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services
industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead
to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these
transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our
counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the
collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not
sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or lease or derivative
exposure due us. Any such losses may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain
qualified employees.

Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key
personnel. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we
may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to
replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key
personnel. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and other regulators. As a large financial and
banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation
practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the Federal
Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators. These limitations could further affect
our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key
personnel, in particular as we are more often competing for personnel with
fintechs and other less regulated entities who may not have the same
limitations on compensation as we do.

We are subject to a variety of operational risks, including the risk of fraud
or theft by employees, which may adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business
continuity, process, third party, information technology, human resource,
model, and fraud risks, each of which may be amplified by increased remote
work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regions' fraud risks include fraud
committed by external parties against the Company or its customers and fraud
committed internally by our associates. Certain fraud risks, including
identity theft and account takeover may increase as a result of customers'
account or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches
of retailers' or other third parties' networks. We have established processes
and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report and
analyze these risks; however, there are inherent limitations to our risk
management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that
we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. If our risk
management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we
may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our
systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and
government agencies. We may also suffer severe reputational damage. Any of
these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations. In particular, the unauthorized disclosure,
misappropriation, mishandling or misuse of personal, non-public,

27

confidential or proprietary information of customers could result in
significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.

Our ability to attract and retain customers and highly-skilled management and
employees is impacted by our reputation. A negative public opinion of us and
our business can result from any number of activities, including our lending
practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and
actions taken by community organizations in response to these activities.
Furthermore, negative publicity regarding Regions as an employer could have an
adverse impact on our reputation, especially with respect to matters of
diversity, pay equity and workplace harassment.

Significant harm to our reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory
or governmental actions, litigation and the activities of our customers, other
participants in the financial services industry or our contractual
counterparties, such as our service providers and vendors. The potential harm
is heightened given increased attention to how corporations address
environmental, social and governance issues.

In addition, a cybersecurity event affecting Regions or our customers' data
could have a negative impact on our reputation and customer confidence in
Regions and its cybersecurity practices. Damage to our reputation could also
adversely affect our credit ratings and access to the capital markets.

Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by
adverse news coverage in traditional media, the widespread use of social media
platforms by virtually every segment of society facilitates the rapid
dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential
harm to our reputation.

We are subject to a variety of systems failure and cybersecurity risks that
could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Failure in or breach of our systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-
party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers),
including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses or the
businesses of our customers. This could result in the disclosure or misuse of
confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our
costs and cause financial losses. As a large financial institution, we depend
on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer
transactions on a continuous basis. As public and regulatory expectations, as
well as our customers' expectations, have increased regarding operational
performance and information security, our systems and infrastructure must
continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions
and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing
systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly
or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including
events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there
could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as
earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; pandemics, such as the COVID-19
pandemic; events arising from local or larger scale political or social
matters, including terrorist acts and civil unrest; and, as described below,
cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards
in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and
widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that
support our businesses and customers. For a discussion of the guidance that
federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber
risk management standards, see the "Supervision and Regulation-Financial
Privacy and Cybersecurity" section of Item 1\. "Business" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Information security risks for large financial institutions, such as Regions,
have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the
proliferation of Internet and mobile banking and the increased sophistication
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states,
activists and other external parties. This increase is expected to continue
and further intensify. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business
also present operational and information security risks to us, including
security breaches or failures of their own systems. As noted above, our
operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of
confidential information in our computer systems and networks. In addition, to
access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers,
smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control
environment. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security
procedures and controls designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cyber-
attack or information security breach, our technologies, systems, networks and
our customers' devices may be the target of cyber-attacks or information
security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering,
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Regions' or our customers'
confidential, proprietary and other information. We also have insurance
coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain
losses associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches, but it
may be insufficient to cover all losses from any such attack or breach,
including any related damage to our reputation. Additionally, cyber-attacks
(such as denial of service, ransomware, or malware attacks), hacking or
terrorist activities, could disrupt Regions' or our customers' or other third
parties' business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been
launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including
Regions. Although these past events have not resulted in a breach of Regions'
client data or account information, such attacks have adversely affected the
performance of Regions Bank's website, www.regions.com, and, in some
instances, prevented customers from accessing Regions Bank's secure websites
for consumer and commercial applications. In all cases, the attacks primarily
resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber-attacks could be more
disruptive and damaging, and

28

Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Work-from-
home arrangements such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19
pandemic may also present additional cybersecurity, information security and
operational risks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an
increase in cybersecurity events, such as phishing attacks and malicious
traffic. Our layered control environment has effectively detected and
prevented any material impact related to these events to date. Our information
security risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the COVID-19
pandemic subsides.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant
additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or
to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We may
also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory
investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyber-attack or information
security breach that impacts us. In addition, our third-party service
providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems or, once
identified, be unable to promptly provide required patches. Further, even if
provided, such patches may not fully remediate any vulnerability or may be
difficult for Regions to implement. The techniques used by cyber criminals
change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated
from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile
foreign governments. These criminals may attempt to fraudulently induce
employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive
information in order to gain access to data or our systems.

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems
that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security
breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access
our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory
fines, civil litigation, penalties or intervention, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, remediation costs, additional
cybersecurity protection costs, increased insurance premiums and/or additional
compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. We could also be adversely
affected if we lost access to information or services from a third-party
service provider as a result of a security breach, system or operational
failure or disruption affecting the third-party service provider. For a more
detailed discussion of these risks and specific occurrences, see the
"Information Security Risk" section of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the
information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with
these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational
damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the GDPR,
California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, and any future
laws and regulations which will be modeled after those laws, are implemented,
the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations,
as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting
obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. In
addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations
relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations
may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for
information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things,
make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for
breach of such laws and regulations.

We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business
infrastructure.

Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data
processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces
and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected
these third-party vendors carefully, performing upfront due diligence and
ongoing monitoring activities, we do not control their actions. Any problems
caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in
services provided by a vendor (including as a result of a cyber-attack, other
information security event or a natural disaster), financial or operational
difficulties for the vendor, issues at third-party vendors to the vendors,
failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor
to provide services for any reason, poor performance of services, failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the
part of employees of any of our vendors, could adversely affect our ability to
deliver products and services to our customers, our reputation and our ability
to conduct our business. In certain situations, replacing these third-party
vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of
such third parties creates an unavoidable, inherent risk to our business
operations. Such risk is generally expected to remain elevated until the
COVID-19 pandemic subsides, as many of our vendors have also been, and may
further be, affected by "stay-at-home" or similar orders, market volatility
and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may
otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements
with us or provide essential services.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and
counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with
clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on
behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other
financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and
counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and,
with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if
made available. If this information is inaccurate, we may be subject to
regulatory action, reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to
the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of
operations.

We are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to
property.

In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real
estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with
respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or
to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental
contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with
investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if
we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to
common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from
environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject
to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on the mortgage secondary market for some of our liquidity.

In 2020, we sold 41.2% of the mortgage loans we originated to the Agencies. We
rely on the Agencies to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan
requirements in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for
additional loans we desire to originate. We cannot provide assurance that the
Agencies will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to
capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other
factors. Additionally, various proposals have been made to reform the U.S.
residential mortgage finance market, including the role of the Agencies. The
exact effects of any such reforms, if implemented, are not yet known, but they
may limit our ability to sell conforming loans to the Agencies. If we are
unable to continue to sell conforming loans to the Agencies, our ability to
fund, and thus originate, additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected,
which would adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we
may conduct.

In connection with our sale of one or more loan portfolios, we may make
certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans
sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and
serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may
be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be
required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans. We may also be
required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of
early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If we are
required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a
remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to
recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases.
Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, we must report as held for sale any loans that we have undertaken
to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed.
We may, therefore, be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of
the loans we classify as held for sale. Management must exercise its judgment
in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status
to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. Any failure to
accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory
investigations and monetary penalties. Any of these actions could adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reclassifying loans
from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected
loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, any loans
classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by changes in interest
rates and by changes in the borrower's creditworthiness. We may be required to
reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Our reported financial results depend on management's selection of accounting
methods and certain assumptions and estimates.

Our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported
financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise
judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and
methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management's judgment of the most
appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some
cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from
two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the
circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results
than would have been reported under a different alternative.

Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial
condition and results of operations. They require management to make
difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.
Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or
using different assumptions or estimates. The Company's critical accounting
estimates include: the allowance for credit losses; fair value measurements;
intangible assets; residential MSRs; and income taxes. Because of the
uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do
one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit
losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the
allowance provided; recognize significant losses on assets carried at fair
value; recognize significant impairment on our goodwill, other intangible
assets or deferred tax asset balances; significantly increase our accrued
income taxes; or significantly decrease the value of our residential MSRs. Any
of these actions could adversely affect our reported financial condition and
results of operations.

If the models that we use in our business perform poorly or provide inadequate
information, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.

We utilize quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or
predicting certain financial values. Models may be used in processes such as
determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending
credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, forecasting financial
performance, predicting losses, improving customer services, maintaining
adherence to laws and regulations, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating
regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial
instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed
models present the risk that our business decisions that consider information
based on such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy or
inaccuracy of that information, which may damage our reputation and adversely
affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. Also,
information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly
designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading.
Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to
capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to
the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant
information is insufficient.

Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially
affect how we report our financial results and condition.

From time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and
reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.
These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we
record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For
example, FASB's CECL accounting standard became effective on January 1, 2020
and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other
financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other
organizations. The standard removes the existing "probable" threshold in GAAP
for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their
estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies
must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The standard had a material impact to the allowance and
capital at adoption. See Regions' impact at adoption in Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In March 2020, the federal banking agencies released an interim final rule,
subsequently adopted as a final rule in August 2020, which allows an addback
to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period and at the
end of the two years the impact is then phased in over the following three
years. Under the rule, during 2020 and 2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital
reflects the change in retained earnings upon initial adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2020, plus 25% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses
since January 1, 2020. Then beginning January 2022, the impact is phased in
over the following three years. Regions has elected to apply this phase-in.

CECL may also impact Regions' ongoing earnings, perhaps materially, due in
part to changes in loan portfolio composition, changes in credit metrics, and
changes in the macroeconomic forecast. Regions' ability to accurately forecast
the future economic environment could result in volatility in the provision as
a result of the new accounting standard.

Risks Arising From the Legal and Regulatory Framework in which Our Business
Operates

We are, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, investigations and
governmental proceedings that may result in liabilities adversely affecting
our financial condition, business or results of operations or in reputational
harm.

We and our subsidiaries are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in
various class actions and other litigation, and may be the subject of
subpoenas, reviews, requests for information, investigations, and formal and
informal proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies regarding our
and their businesses and activities (including subpoenas, requests for
information and investigations related to the activities of our customers).
Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of
operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including
adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money
penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restrictions on our
business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even
if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause
significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the
operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse
judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation
by government or self-regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation,
investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or self-
regulatory agencies (including the inquiries mentioned above) begin
independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. In general, the
amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or
investigations, including those relating to anti-money laundering matters or
sales practices, have increased substantially and are likely to remain
elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas
or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have
significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including
loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets,
and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for
a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact our
supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit our
activities.

Additional information relating to our litigation, investigations and other
proceedings is discussed in Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an
adverse impact on our operations.

We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and
examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the
businesses in which we may permissibly engage. The laws and regulations
governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our
depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund,
not our shareholders or other creditors. These laws and regulations govern a
variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control,
maintenance of adequate capital, and general business operations and financial
condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and
investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on
dividends and repurchases of our capital securities, establishment of branch
offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). Further,
we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many
activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict
us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can be no assurance that any
regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained.

Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing
continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such
changes cannot be predicted. Changes to the legal and regulatory framework
governing our operations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA, have
significantly revised the laws and regulations under which we operate.
Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time, and new
legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions Bank and our
subsidiaries, including any changes resulting from the recent change in U.S.
presidential administration and change in control of the U.S. Senate.

Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and
governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect
us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to
appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could
result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to
our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Our regulatory capital position is
discussed in greater detail in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and
Restrictions" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.

Regions and Regions Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and
types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators
implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be
restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited
from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing
or redeeming capital securities.

Regions and Regions Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital
adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the
Basel III framework. The Basel Committee has published standards that it
describes as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms.
These standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an
aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Among other things,
these standards revise the standardized approach for credit risk and provide a
new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The impact of these
standards on us will depend on the manner in which the revisions are
implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as Regions and Regions
Bank.

For more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity
requirements, see Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions"
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8\. of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Rulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory
and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.

Since its formation, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that
could have a significant impact on our business and the financial services
industry more generally. We may also be required to add additional compliance
personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our
business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely
affected as a result.

We may not be able to complete future acquisitions, may not be successful in
realizing the benefits of any future acquisitions that are completed, or may
choose not to pursue acquisition opportunities we might find beneficial.

We may, from time to time, evaluate and engage in the acquisition or
divestiture of businesses (including their assets or liabilities, such as
loans or deposits). We must generally satisfy a number of meaningful
conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including in certain
cases, federal and state bank regulatory approvals.

32

The process for obtaining required regulatory approvals, particularly for
large financial institutions, like Regions, can be difficult, time-consuming
and unpredictable. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and
competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability,
or our perceived inability, to obtain required regulatory approvals in a
timely manner or at all.

Assuming we are able to successfully complete one or more transactions, we may
not be able to successfully integrate and realize the expected synergies from
any completed transaction in a timely manner or at all. In particular, we may
be held responsible by federal and state regulators for regulatory and
compliance failures at an acquired business prior to the date of the
acquisition, and these failures by the acquired company may have negative
consequences for us, including the imposition of formal or informal
enforcement actions. Completion and integration of any transaction may also
divert management attention from other matters, result in additional costs and
expenses, or adversely affect our relationships with our customers and
employees, any of which may adversely affect our business or results of
operations. Future acquisitions may also result in dilution of our current
shareholders' ownership interests or may require we incur additional
indebtedness or use a substantial amount of our available cash and other
liquid assets. As a result, our financial condition may be affected, and we
may become more susceptible to economic conditions and competitive pressures.

Increases in FDIC insurance assessments may adversely affect our earnings.

Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we
are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control
the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. The
FDIC may require us to pay higher FDIC assessments than we currently do or may
charge additional special assessments or future prepayments if, for example,
there are financial institution failures in the future. Any increase in
deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. See the "Supervision and
Regulation-Deposit Insurance" discussion within Item 1. "Business" and the
"Non-Interest Expense" discussion within Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC's deposit
insurance assessments applicable to Regions Bank.

Unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses may adversely affect our
ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities.

The Federal Reserve conducts supervisory stress testing of Regions to evaluate
our ability to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and
stressed financial scenarios generated by the Federal Reserve. The Federal
Reserve also has implemented the SCB framework which created a firm-specific
risk sensitive buffer that is informed by the results of supervisory stress
testing, and is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine
effective minimum ratio requirements. Firm specific SCB requirements, as well
as a summary of the results of certain aspects of the Federal Reserve's
supervisory stress testing and firm specific results are released publicly.

Although the theoretical stress tests are not meant to assess our current
condition or outlook, our customers may misinterpret and negatively react to
the results of these stress tests despite the strength of our financial
condition. Any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit
our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new
business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or
effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our regulators may also require us to raise additional capital or take other
actions, or may impose restrictions on capital distributions, based on the
results of the supervisory stress tests, such as requiring revisions or
resubmission of our annual capital plan, which could adversely affect our
ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital securities. In addition, we
may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not
be able to do so on terms that we believe are advantageous to Regions or its
current shareholders. Any such capital raises, if required, may also be
dilutive to our existing shareholders. Further, as discussed in the
"Supervision and Regulation" section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form
10-K, the Federal Reserve in August 2020 announced that Regions' initial SCB
would be 3.0 percent. This is higher than the SCB assigned to some peer banks
and therefore could limit our future ability to make capital distributions
relative to those peer banks should our capital ratios decline.

If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank
financial company were triggered, we could face assessments for the Orderly
Liquidation Fund.

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new mechanism, the OLA, for liquidation of
systemically important BHCs and non-bank financial companies. The OLA is
administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC's bank resolution model. The
Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority
only after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a
recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-
thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation
Fund, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based
assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be
made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would
have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if
necessary, on, among others, BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50
billion or more, such as Regions. Any such assessments may adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends,
distributions and other payments.

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other
subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay
dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on our outstanding
debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory
limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as well as by
us to our shareholders. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State
of Alabama affect the ability of Regions Bank to pay dividends and other
distributions to us and to make loans to us. If Regions Bank is unable to make
dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise
available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and
preferred shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding
debt. See the "Shareholders' Equity" section of Item 7\. "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our right to participate in a
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is
subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the
extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be
recognized. As a result, shares of our capital stock are effectively
subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries' total deposits and
borrowings were approximately $123.3 billion.

We may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.

Holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such
dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such
payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common
stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common
stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock
prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our
capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or
acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends
on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend
period.

We are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to
pay dividends on our capital stock. For example, it is the policy of the
Federal Reserve that BHCs should generally pay dividends on common stock only
out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with
the organization's expected future needs, asset quality and financial
condition. Additionally, Regions is subject to the Federal Reserve's SCB
requirement whereby supervisory stress testing informs a buffer above
regulatory minimum capital levels that must be maintained to avoid
restrictions on capital distributions. Further, as discussed in the
"Supervision and Regulation" section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form
10-K, the Federal Reserve has extended, with modest adjustment, the
distribution restrictions previously implemented through the first quarter of
2021 in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is unknown
if these distribution restrictions will be extended beyond the first quarter.
Lastly, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us
for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends
on our capital stock.

Anti-takeover and banking laws and certain agreements and charter provisions
may adversely affect share value.

Certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of
incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us
without our Board's approval. Under federal law, subject to certain
exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies
before acquiring control of a BHC. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of
voting stock of a BHC or state member bank, including shares of our common
stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer "controls" the BHC
or state member bank. Also, as noted under the "Supervision and Regulation"
section of Item 1\. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a BHC must obtain the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring
direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting
shares of any bank, including Regions Bank. One factor the federal banking
agencies must consider in certain acquisitions is the systemic impact of the
transaction. This may make it more difficult for large institutions to acquire
other large institutions and may otherwise delay the regulatory approval
process, possibly by requiring public hearings. Similarly, under Alabama state
law, a person or group of persons must receive approval from the
Superintendent of Banks before acquiring "control" of an Alabama bank or any
entity having control of an Alabama bank. For the purposes of determining
whether approval is required, "control" is defined as the power, directly or
indirectly, to vote the lesser of (i) 25% or more of any class of voting
securities of an Alabama bank (or any entity having control of an Alabama
bank) or (ii) 10% or more of any class of voting securities of an Alabama bank
(or any entity having control of an Alabama bank) if no other person will own,
control, or hold the power to vote a majority of that class of voting
securities following the acquisition of such voting securities. Furthermore,
there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used
to delay or block a takeover attempt. For example, holders of our preferred
stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value. If
and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for
at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not
consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our Board
will automatically be increased by two, and the preferred shareholders will be
entitled to elect the two additional directors. Also, the affirmative vote or
consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding
shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-
exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or
consolidation of Regions with or into another entity, unless certain
requirements are met. These

34

statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation,
including the rights of the holders of our preferred stock, could result in
Regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus adversely
affect our share value.

Risks Related to Our Capital or Debt

The market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate.

The market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant
fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our
operations or business prospects. The market price of our capital stock,
including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional
interests in our preferred stock, may be subject to fluctuations unrelated to
our operating performance or prospects.

Our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.

Our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares
representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all
of Regions' existing and future indebtedness and Regions' other non-equity
claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us,
including claims in the event of our liquidation. As of December 31, 2020,
Regions' total liabilities were approximately $129.3 billion, and we may incur
additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources.
Additionally, if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of Regions
Bank falls below the required minimums, we or Regions Bank could be forced to
raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt securities,
including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or other applicable
securities.

We may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but may
be unable to do so.

We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with
sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and other
business purposes. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will
depend on, among other things, prevailing conditions in the capital markets,
which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. An economic
slowdown or loss of confidence in financial institutions could increase our
cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of
capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings
from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We cannot be assured that
capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence
that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the
confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Regions Bank or counterparties
participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt ratings, may
adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in
turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable
terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of
existing shareholders' equity ownership.

We may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to
raise additional capital, support growth, or to make acquisitions. Further, we
may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our
employees. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and
economic interests of our existing shareholders.

quarter of 2020. Regions did not repurchase any outstanding common stock under
this plan during 2020.

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of
the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial
aspects of Regions Financial Corporation's ("Regions" or "the Company")
business, particularly regarding its 2020 results. Cross references to more
detailed information regarding each topic within MD&A and the consolidated
financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in
understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with
the entire MD&A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other
sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. Preliminary data shows real GDP contracted by
3.5 percent in 2020, and Regions expects real GDP growth of 4.8 percent in
2021 and 4.4 percent in 2022. The February 2021 baseline forecast anticipates
the level of real GDP will return to the level as of the fourth quarter of
2019, the last quarter free of the effects of COVID-19, in the third quarter
of 2021. Until there has been much wider vaccine distribution, the COVID-19
virus will pose a downside risk to near-term growth, while further progress on
the vaccine front poses an upside opportunity for growth in late 2021 to early
2022. As the pandemic is still ongoing, however, there remains a heightened
degree of uncertainty around economic forecasts being made at present.

The surge in COVID-19 cases that began in mid-November 2020 and which led many
state and local governments to impose new limitations on activity, has begun
to abate, but the effects continue to act as a drag on the process of healing
from the economic and financial impacts of the pandemic. The direct effects of
the recent surge, however, were largely concentrated amongst a few industry
groups in the services sector, such as leisure and hospitality services, as
has been the case over the course of the pandemic. Still, there remain risks
to the broader economy in the near term.

There are, however, reasons to expect the pace of economic growth to improve
as 2021 progresses. Based on information now available, it is expected that
more widespread distribution of a vaccine against the COVID-19 virus will be
in place by summer 2021, which should eventually lead to state and local
governments lifting any remaining restrictions on activity. While there are
uncertainties as to whether, or to what extent, consumer behavior and
attitudes will have changed after the experiences of the pandemic, a more
widespread distribution of an effective vaccine is expected to provide a
meaningful boost to economic growth. This will be amplified by what is
expected to be even further fiscal policy support once the new administration
and the new Congress are in place.

A second round of fiscal support was signed into law in late-December 2020,
providing another round of Economic Impact Payments of up to $600 for eligible
individuals and an extension of supplemental unemployment insurance benefits
and pandemic-related unemployment benefit programs. In the month of January
2021, Treasury distributed more than $140 billion in Economic Impact Payments.
Though some of these funds will be spent, a considerable portion will go into
savings or will be used to pay down debt of our customers, as was the case
with the first round of payments provided under the CARES Act. The Biden
administration is expected to push for another round of Economic Impact
Payments of up to $1,400 for eligible individuals and seek to further extend
unemployment insurance benefits being paid by the federal government. On top
of an already elevated saving rate, these additional funds add to the
potential for a significant burst of spending once the economy is more fully
reopened, which Regions expects to be the case at some point in 2021. It is
also likely that the Biden administration will seek increased funding for
health care and new funding for infrastructure spending and financial
assistance to state and local governments.

While it is reasonable to expect a transition to a faster rate of economic
growth at some point in 2021, the timing of any such transition is highly
uncertain, and the early months of 2021 could be challenging unless the
ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases subsides. Still, if economic growth does not
accelerate as the year progresses, that will likely be accompanied by a faster
rate of inflation. While inflation is not likely to accelerate to a degree
that would lead the FOMC to respond, by raising short-term rates, it would
nonetheless likely add upward pressure to longer-term interest rates, which
have risen in early 2021 on the prospect of larger federal government budget
deficits. With the short end of the yield curve well-anchored, persistent
steepening of the yield curve could at some point lead the FOMC to alter the
composition of FRB asset purchases, putting more emphasis on longer-dated
assets and less emphasis on shorter-dated assets. Regions does not expect any
changes in the pace of FRB asset purchases in 2021, nor any changes in the Fed
funds rate target range at least through 2022.

The patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint will be broadly
similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. Florida's economy has an above-
average exposure to leisure and hospitality services, while Texas and
Louisiana have above-average exposure to energy, so these economies could be
more prone to lasting effects if the recovery does prove to be slower than is
now anticipated.

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions'
forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of December 31, 2020. See the
"Allowance" section for further information.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the
economic environment in which the Company operates. The adverse economic
conditions and uncertainty in the economic outlook as of December 31, 2020
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the 2020 financial results in the
areas as described below. Regions expects that the pandemic will continue to
influence economic conditions and the Company's financial results in future
quarters.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions re-opened branches for walk-in services.
Regions continues to keep measures in place to ensure associate and customer
safety, which include reduced occupancy levels to provide for social
distancing, implementation of stringent cleaning protocols, and providing
appropriate facemasks and other sanitizing supplies. As of December 31, 2020,
only 3 percent of branches were temporarily closed due to COVID-related
impacts; this percentage was down to less than 1 percent as of January 31,
2021. Regions is in the process of implementing a phased approach to return
more remote working associates to office locations in accordance with
applicable safety protocols. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 90 percent
of the Company's non-branch associates were working remotely.

Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the remainder of
the year, the Company offered special financial assistance to support
customers who were experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19
pandemic. This assistance included offering customer payment deferrals or
forbearances to existing loans over a set period of time, typically 90 days.
Residential mortgage payment assistance was granted through forbearance.
During the forbearance period, a borrower's payment obligation is suspended
and no foreclosure action will be pursued. All payments are then due at
expiration of the forbearance period, unless the loan has been modified. For
most other loan products (commercial and consumer products except for
residential real estate), payment assistance is granted through deferrals or
extensions. Deferrals and extensions are different than forbearances in that
all payments are normally not due at the end of the deferral or extension
period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced. For most products, interest
continues to accrue on the loan during the deferral or forbearance period,
unless the loan is on non-accrual.

Regions' outstanding deferrals have declined throughout 2020, and as of
December 31, 2020, more than 95 percent of the loan balances previously in
deferral were either current or less than 30 days past due. The following
table provides detail of the outstanding loan deferrals by quarter (the second
quarter of 2020 is the first quarter shown below since most deferrals
commenced in the second quarter):

total consumer balances.

(2) Approximately 60% of the residential first mortgage-portfolio loan
balances in deferral at December 31, 2020 were guaranteed by the U.S.
government.

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan
modifications related to COVID-19 beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier
of 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends
or December 31, 2020 were eligible for relief from TDR classification. On
December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law and
extended the relief from TDR classification through the earlier of 60 days
after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends or January
1, 2022. Regions elected this provision. Refer to Table 23 "Troubled Debt
Restructurings" for further information.

As a certified SBA lender, Regions assisted customers through the loan process
under the PPP in 2020, and some of the loans originated under this program
were forgiven in the fourth quarter of 2020. Under this program, Regions has
approximately 42,000 loans outstanding totaling approximately $3.6 billion as
of December 31, 2020. In December of 2020, additional funds were approved
under the SBA's PPP. Regions is participating in this round of funding and
will assist customers who meet the criteria under the program.

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the
Company well-prepared to respond to the increase in customer borrowing needs.
The Company has ample sources of liquidity that include a granular and stable
deposit base, cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at
the FHLB, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at
the Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders'
Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. While consumer
spending increased moderately in the second half of 2020 as restrictions on
economic activity were eased throughout the country, spending remained below
pre-pandemic levels. The Company expects consumer service charges to grow in
2021 compared to 2020; however, given current spending levels, the Company
estimates consumer service charges will remain approximately 10 percent to 15
percent below 2019 levels. See Table 5 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Regions assessed goodwill for impairment in light of the economic environment
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, Regions
concluded that a triggering event had occurred which required Regions to
perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test which did not result in
impairment. As of October 1, 2020, Regions completed its annual goodwill
impairment test by performing a qualitative assessment and determined that it
was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's
reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value. Refer to the
"Goodwill" section for further detail.

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail.

2020 Results

Regions reported net income from continuing operations available to common
shareholders of $1.0 billion, or $1.03 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to
net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $1.5
billion, or $1.50 per diluted share, in 2019.

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $3.9 billion in 2020
compared to $3.8 billion in 2019. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent
basis) was 3.21 percent in 2020, reflecting a 24 basis point decrease from
2019. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by increases in
loan balances due to PPP lending, the impact of the Company's April 2020
equipment finance acquisition, increased production of residential first
mortgage loans, a decrease in deposit costs, and decreases in short and long-
term borrowings through the redemption of senior notes and paydowns of FHLB
advances. Net interest income also benefited from the execution of the
Company's interest rate hedging strategy. The decline in net interest margin
was primarily driven by elevated liquidity as evidenced by higher cash levels
held at the Federal Reserve and increases in average loan balances at lower
interest rates. Additionally, net interest margin was negatively impacted by
the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at
lower market interest rates.

The provision for credit losses totaled $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to the
provision for loan losses of $387 million in 2019. The provision was higher
than net charge-offs by $818 million in 2020. The increase in the provision
for credit losses was driven primarily by CECL adoption, a change in the
economic outlook due to COVID-19, and higher net charge-offs. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis
for further detail.

Non-interest income was $2.4 billion in 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in 2019.
The increase was primarily driven by an increase in capital markets income,
mortgage income and other miscellaneous income during 2020. The increases were
partially offset by lower service charges and card and ATM fees. See Table 5
"Non-Interest Income from Continuing Operations" for further details.

Non-interest expense was $3.6 billion in 2020 and $3.5 billion in 2019. The
increase was driven primarily by higher salaries and employee benefits (which
includes associates added through the Ascentium acquisition), furniture and
equipment expense, branch consolidation, property and equipment charges and
loss on early extinguishments of debt. These increases were partially offset
by decreases in checkcard expense and other miscellaneous expenses. See Table
6 "Non-Interest Expense from Continuing Operations" for further details.

Regions' effective tax rate was 16.8 percent in 2020 compared to 20.3 percent
in 2019. The effective tax rate is lower in 2020 due primarily to a consistent
level of permanent income tax preferences having a proportionally larger
impact relative to pre-tax earnings, which were negatively impacted in 2020
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the "Income Taxes" section for further
details.

Capital

Capital Actions

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020. During the third quarter, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement
for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0
percent. The Federal Reserve may decide at any point through March 31, 2021 to
update Regions' and other firms' SCB requirement based on the results of its
supervisory stress test associated with the capital plan resubmission
disclosed in December 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the first quarter of 2021. On
February 3, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend for the first quarter
of 2021 of $0.155 per share, which was in compliance with the Federal
Reserve's SCB framework.

In 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of $1.370 billion of the
Company's common stock, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third
quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. Regions did not repurchase
any shares under this plan or otherwise during 2020. Any repurchases in the
near term will be considered with the intent to operate at the higher end of
the Company's range for CET1 of 9.5 percent to 10 percent. The Company
regularly performs internal stress testing which can result in modifications
to the operating range.

•Note 15 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements

Regulatory Capital

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the
Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The
Basel III Rules maintained the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered
well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%,
respectively. At December 31, 2020, Regions' Tier 1 capital and Total capital
ratios were estimated to be 11.39% and 13.56%, respectively.

The Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' CET1 ratio at
December 31, 2020 was estimated to be 9.84%.

Form 10-K:

•"Regulatory Requirements" section of MD&A

•Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the
consolidated financial statements

Loan Portfolio and Credit

During 2020, total loans increased by $2.3 billion or 2.8 percent compared to
2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the commercial
portfolio of $2.7 billion, which reflected loans acquired through the
Company's equipment finance acquisition, as well as loans originated through
the PPP program totaling $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The economy has
been and will continue to be the primary factor which influences Regions' loan
portfolio. As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Regions' loan
portfolio. Additionally, low interest rates drove growth in the residential
mortgage portfolio. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for
further discussion.

Net charge-offs totaled $512 million, or 0.58 percent of average loans, in
2020, compared to $358 million, or 0.43 percent in 2019, reflecting increased
charge-offs in the commercial and industrial loan portfolios. On January 1,
2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss allowance
methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. The allowance was
2.69 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2020, an
increase from 1.10 percent at December 31, 2019. The coverage ratio of
allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 308 percent at
December 31, 2020, compared to 180 percent at December 31, 2019.

Liquidity

At the end of 2020, Regions Bank had $16.4 billion in cash on deposit with the
Federal Reserve and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 70 percent. Cash and cash
equivalents at the parent company totaled $1.5 billion. Regions' liquidity
policy related to minimum holding company cash requires the holding company to
maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service
and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million.

At December 31, 2020, the Company's borrowing capacity with the Federal
Reserve was $12.8 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing
availability with the FHLB was $16.2 billion based on available collateral at
the same date. Regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that can be utilized by the Company to
issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has
authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal
amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time.

Regions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its
available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by Regions'
internal liquidity policy. Regions was fully compliant with those requirements
as of year-end.

GENERAL

The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in
understanding Regions' financial position and results of operations. The
emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2020 and 2019;
in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when
appropriate.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Recent Acquisitions

On February 27, 2020, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement
to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company
headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and
included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses.
Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail.

On May 31, 2019, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Highland
Associates, Inc., an institutional investment firm based in Birmingham,
Alabama. The transaction closed on August 1, 2019.

Dispositions

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. (now Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc). The transaction closed on
July 2, 2018. The gain associated with the transaction amounted to $281
million ($196 million after-tax).

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on
April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not
included in the sale; they are included in the Wealth Management segment.

Results of operations for the entities sold are presented separately as
discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated
statements of income. Other expenses related to the transaction are also
included in discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3 "Discontinued Operations"
and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated
financial statements for further details.

Business Segments

Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services,
as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions
carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other.

See Note 23 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial
statements for further information on Regions' business segments.

________

(1)Due to the immaterial impact of other financing income and depreciation
expense on operating lease assets in 2020, interest income and interest
expense for prior periods have been revised to reflect the 2020 presentation.

(2)Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses
is the sum of the provision for loans losses and the provision for unfunded
credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded
commitments was included in other non-interest expense.

(3)Due to the immaterial impact of the discontinued operations, the balance
sheet has not been presented on a continuing operations basis.

(4)See Table 2 for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

(5)Current year common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and
Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average balances of loans", "adjusted ending
balances of loans", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted
efficiency ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio", "return on average tangible
common shareholders' equity" on a consolidated and continuing operations
basis, and end of period "tangible common shareholders' equity", and related
ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial
measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for
period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors
in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to
assess the performance of Regions' business because management does not
consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of
ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP
financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the
Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the
Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

Average total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to
commercial loans transferred to held for sale, loans originated through the
SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer exit portfolio, the indirect
vehicles exit portfolio, and the impact of the first quarter 2018 residential
first mortgage loan sale, as well as including the impact of the fourth
quarter of 2018 reclassification of purchase cards to commercial and
industrial loans from other assets to arrive at adjusted average total loans
(non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a
meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same
basis as that applied by management.

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to
loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss
allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government, are excluded from total loans and the related credit loss is
excluded from the total allowance for credit losses.

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) is presented excluding
certain adjustments related to Tax Reform to

46

arrive at adjusted net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-
GAAP). Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest
income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent
basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted
efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common shareholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common shareholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common shareholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans
(GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of
ending total loans (GAAP) to ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP) and a
computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 4) a
reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common
shareholders (GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of net interest
income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest
income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of
non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 8) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 10) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), and 11) a reconciliation of average and ending
shareholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

_________

(1)In the fourth quarter of 2020, Regions made the decision to sell a certain
portfolio of $239 million of commercial and industrial loans, which were
reclassified to held for sale as of December 31, 2020. Adjustments to average
loan balances assume a simple day-weighted average impact for the fourth
quarter of 2020, and are equal to the ending balance of the loans moved to
held for sale for the prior periods.

(2)In the fourth quarter of 2019, Regions decided not to renew a third party
relationship.

(3)Adjustments to average loan balances assume a simple day-weighted average
impact for the year ended December 31, 2018, and are equal to the ending
balance of the residential first mortgage loans sold for the prior periods.

(4)On December 31, 2018, purchasing cards were reclassified to commercial and
industrial loans from other assets.

(5)In the second quarter of 2020, Regions recorded $7 million in professional
fees and related costs associated with the April 2020 equipment finance
acquisition, Regions recorded $3 million of contingent legal and regulatory
accruals during the second quarter of 2016 related to previously disclosed
matters.

(6)Refer to Table 3 for computation of net interest margin.

(7)Amounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.

(8)Insurance proceeds recognized in the third quarter of 2016 are related to
the previously disclosed settlement with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

(9)In the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold $167 million of affordable
housing residential mortgage loans for a gain of $8 million. In the fourth
quarter of 2016, the Company sold affordable housing residential mortgage
loans to FHLMC for a $5 million gain.

Approximately $91 million were sold with recourse, resulting in a deferred
gain of $5 million, which was recognized during the second quarter of 2017.

(10)Due to the immaterial impact of the discontinued operations, the balance
sheet has not been presented on a continuing operations basis.

  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting
principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles
conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking
practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related
primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements,
intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets),
residential MSRs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.
Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial
guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Regions determines its
allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance.

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss
allowance methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. See Note 1
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit
Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for information about CECL
adoption, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the
allowance.

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to
external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by
changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate
demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health
pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural
disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of
the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance
to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory
agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the
level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in
certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in
circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or
certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The
scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in
actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally
estimated amounts. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in
economic conditions, including changes resulting from various pandemic
scenarios, the impact of government stimulus programs to individuals and
businesses, and the timely distribution and efficacy of a vaccine could affect
borrower behavior. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management
applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision
based on then-current circumstances and conditions.

In December 2020, the FRB released its estimated modeled credit losses for
Regions as part of its second round of stress test results for 2020. The
second round of FRB stress test results included two hypothetical scenarios
that were more severe than the severely adverse scenario from the supervisory
stress test results released in the second quarter of 2020. In the second
round of stress test results, the FRB estimated credit losses in its severely
adverse scenario of $6 billion for Regions. Whereas this scenario assumed a
different macroeconomic outlook than Regions', it may represent a possible
range of potential credit losses in such a scenario. See the Federal Reserve
stress test disclosures for more information regarding their assumptions in
this stress test.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor
or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors
and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance. Changes in the factors
and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent
across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be
directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset
deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical
alternate economic forecast, Regions compared the modeled quantitative
allowance results using favorable and unfavorable scenarios ( +/- 1 standard
deviation) to the base economic forecast. The difference between the base
macroeconomic forecast and the favorable scenario over the two year R&S period
results in an approximate 15 percent decrease to the modeled allowance
results. The difference between the base and the unfavorable scenario over the
two year R&S period results in an approximate 20 percent increase to the
modeled allowance results.

Similar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential
changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of
the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the
allowance. Changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not
be consistent across product or industry types. Regions conducted a separate
sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and
investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers
relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Regions stressed risk ratings
by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. This scenario
generated a 36 percent increase in the modeled allowance for the commercial
and investor real estate portfolios.

Fair Value Measurements

A portion of the Company's assets and liabilities is carried at fair value,
with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale,
mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily
determinable market values), residential MSRs and derivative assets and
liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects
other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such
as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower
of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated
costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate
is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market
information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value
are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific
properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts
certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair
value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.

Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price
that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability
(an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses
judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would
transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of
activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity,
management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair
value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party
investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the
asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value
estimates.

A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about
the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a
restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance.
Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair
value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities
traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not
available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where
observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from
model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the
market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations).
These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates for
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models,
discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the
use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable
to the subject asset or liability.

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value,
including pricing validation processes.

Intangible Assets

Regions' intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the
fair value of net assets of acquired businesses ("goodwill") and other
identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer relationship
intangibles, core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card
relationships). Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Goodwill is allocated to each of
Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank, Consumer
Bank, and Wealth Management). Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual
basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate
impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).

Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to
determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the evidence, the
Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book
value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to
bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than
not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment test is
performed. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. To the extent that the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, impairment is not
indicated. Conversely, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is
below its carrying amount, a loss (which could be

52

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

material) would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated
fair value. The carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined
from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets. Adverse changes in the
economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other
factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of
goodwill.

During the second quarter of 2020, Regions assessed events and circumstances
for all three reporting units that could potentially indicate goodwill
impairment including analyzing the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Based
on these events and circumstances, and after assessing indicators such as
recent operating performance, changes in market capitalization, and changes in
the business climate, Regions concluded that a triggering event had occurred
which required Regions to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The
results of the test did not require Regions to record a goodwill impairment
charge as all three reporting units continued to have a fair value in excess
of book value.

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1,
2020, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit
level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing
the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances
since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including
reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory
actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific
factors, and trends in the banking industry. After assessing the totality of
the events and circumstances, the Company determined that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. Therefore,
a quantitative impairment test was deemed unnecessary. Refer to Note 10
"Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional
discussion of goodwill.

Specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could
negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment
include: a protracted decline in the Company's market capitalization; adverse
business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher
loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum
regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to Note 13
"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory
requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those
resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act); and/or a significant protraction in the
current level of interest rates.

Other material identifiable intangible assets, primarily acquired customer
relationship intangibles, core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card
relationships, are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter)
for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the
intangible asset. These events could include loss of customer relationships,
loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit card accounts and/or
balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the
extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an
impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events
or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions' operating
results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be
reasonably estimated.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights

Regions has elected to measure and report its residential MSRs using the fair
value method. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do
not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the
exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are
therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed
in the "Fair Value Measurements" section. Specific characteristics of the
underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential
MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing
portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type
and contractual note rate, and values its residential MSRs using discounted
cash flow modeling techniques. These techniques require management to make
estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration
historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount
rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. Changes in interest rates,
prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential MSRs
which impacts earnings. The carrying value of residential MSRs was $296
million at December 31, 2020. Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis,
Regions estimates that a reduction in benchmark interest rates of 25 basis
points and 50 basis points would reduce the December 31, 2020 fair value of
residential MSRs by approximately 10 percent ($28 million) and 19 percent ($56
million), respectively. Conversely, 25 basis point and 50 basis point
increases in these rates would increase the December 31, 2020 fair value of
residential MSRs by approximately 9 percent ($28 million) and 18 percent ($55
million), respectively. Regions also estimates that an increase in servicing
costs of approximately $10 per loan, or 16 percent, would result in a decline
in the value of the residential MSRs by approximately $10 million.

The pro forma fair value analyses presented above demonstrates the sensitivity
of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates. This
sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome. Refer to Note 7
"Servicing of Financial Assets"to the consolidated financial statements for
additional disclosure on residential mortgage servicing rights.

Income Taxes

Accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or
other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and
reflect management's estimate of income taxes to be paid or received.

53

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

Deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid
or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method. The
net balance is reported as a component of either other assets or other
liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company
determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive
and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating
results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable
income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax
planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes
forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated book-tax differences
and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to
taxing jurisdictions. These assumptions require significant judgment and are
consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the
underlying businesses. The realization of the deferred tax assets could be
reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than
forecasted. For a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets,
refer to the "Income Taxes" section found later in this report.

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local
jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be
interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in a range
of outcomes. Thus, the Company is required to exercise judgment regarding the
application of these tax laws and regulations. The Company will evaluate and
recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties. Due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result
in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax
liabilities.

The Company's estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and
income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new
legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes
in income tax rates. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the
Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1,
2018, Tax Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax
rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the
consolidated financial statements for further details.

OPERATING RESULTS

NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN

Net interest income is Regions' principal source of income and is one of the
most important elements of Regions' ability to meet its overall performance
goals. Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased $144 million
in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by increases in loan balances
attributable to PPP lending, the Ascentium acquisition in the second quarter
of 2020, increased production of residential first mortgage loans, a decrease
in deposit costs, and active cash management strategies. This includes
increases in investment securities balances and decreases in short and long-
term borrowings balances through the redemption of Parent and Bank senior
notes and paydowns of FHLB advances.

Net interest income also benefited from the Company's interest rate hedging
strategy. The hedges are designed to protect net interest income in a low
short-term rate environment, such as the one that currently exists, and had a
positive impact to net interest income of approximately $260 million for all
of 2020. The Company began adding hedges in 2018; however, they were designed
to become effective beginning in 2020. Therefore, the hedging strategy
produced no benefits before 2020.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve dramatically
increased policy accommodation during 2020, through lowering its policy rate
to near-zero and increasing the size of its balance sheet. This, coupled with
a sharp revision in global economic growth trends, resulted in decreases in
long-term interest rates to all-time lows in 2020. Long-term interest rates
are generally represented by the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The
average yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate decreased to 0.89 percent in
2020, compared to 2.14 percent in 2019.

The net interest margin decreased to 3.21 percent in 2020 from 3.45 percent in
2019. The decline was primarily driven by elevated liquidity, as indicated by
higher cash levels and increases in loan balances due to PPP lending. Lower
market interest rates also impacted the net interest margin in 2020. The net
interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan
portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates during
2020. However, the reduction in loan and securities yields was almost
completely offset by additional hedging income and lower funding costs.
Average earning asset yields were 71 basis points lower in 2020 as compared to
2019, and interest-bearing liability rates were 67 basis points lower. As a
result, the net interest rate spread only decreased 4 basis points to 3.00
percent in 2020 compared to 3.04 percent in 2019.

Regions' asset yields were impacted by the lower interest rate environment.
The taxable investment securities portfolio, which contains significant
residential fixed-rate exposure, decreased in yield to 2.34 percent in 2020
from 2.65 percent in 2019. The yield decreased primarily due to reinvestment,
adding new securities at lower yields, and higher premium amortization driven
by higher premium balances as a result of securities purchases combined with
increased prepayment speeds. Notably, non-economic increases to prepayment
speeds on GNMA collateral based on favorable economics for servicers to
purchase loans in forbearance out of pools contributed to elevated premium
amortization in 2020.

The loan portfolio decreased in yield to 4.15 percent in 2020 from 4.69
percent in 2019. The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-
term interest rates such as 30-day LIBOR, which averaged 0.52 percent in 2020,
compared to 2.22 percent in 2019. Notably the hedging program, which protects
against lower short-term rates, contributed 0.30 percent to

54

loan yields in 2020. Reinvestment of fixed rate loans at lower long-term
interest rates throughout 2020 also contributed to the yield decrease. Loan
yields were also negatively impacted by unfavorable remixing of the loan
portfolio during 2020, including the intentional runoff of higher yielding
unsecured consumer loans.

The Company's funding costs also decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Deposit costs decreased to 16 basis points for 2020 compared to 47 basis
points for 2019. The decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates and
active deposit cost management, coupled with a higher non-interest bearing
balance mix. The average long-term borrowing balance of $6.6 billion in 2020
was lower than 2019 due to the redemption of Parent and Bank senior notes and
the elimination of all FHLB advances. The cost on these borrowings decreased
76 basis points, as the majority of Regions' long-term debt is effectively
converted to floating rate debt through the execution of interest rate swaps.

12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Notes:

•The change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been
allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the
relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

•The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the
statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019, and 2018, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the
related federal tax benefit.

The mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions'
primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain
types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for
example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as
securities, Federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreements to
resell. Average earning assets in 2020 totaled $122.7 billion, an increase of
$12.5 billion as compared to the prior year, due to increased balances at the
FRB and loan balances. See the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Loans"
sections for further details.

Average loans as a percentage of average earning assets were 72 percent and 76
percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remaining categories of earning
assets are shown in Table 3 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and
Yield/Rate Analysis". The proportion of average earning assets to average
total assets, which was 89 percent in 2020 and 88 percent in 2019, measures
the effectiveness of management's efforts to invest available funds into the
most profitable earning vehicles. Funding for Regions' earning assets comes
from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. Another significant
factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets
funded by interest-bearing liabilities. The percentage of average earning
assets funded by average interest-bearing liabilities was 60 percent in 2020
and 66 percent in 2019.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan
losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in
management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the
contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance
sheet date. Regions adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, Regions
classified the provision for unfunded credit losses as provision for credit
losses. Prior to 2020, the provision for unfunded credit losses was included
in non-interest expense. During 2020, the provision for credit losses totaled
$1.3 billion and net charge-offs were $512 million. This compares to a
provision for loan losses of $387 million and net charge-offs of $358 million
in 2019.

For further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses,
see the "Allowance for Credit Losses" and "Risk Management" sections found
later in this report. See also Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund and overdraft
fees, corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other
customer transaction-related service charges. The decrease in 2020 compared to
2019 was the result of lower customer spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Government stimulus programs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic aided in the
increase of customer deposits, elevation of customer liquidity and also
resulted in a reduction in overdraft charges. Consumer spending continues to
normalize and the Company expects consumer service charges to grow in 2021
compared to 2020 levels; however, due to changes in customer behavior and
enhancements to overdraft practices and transaction posting, the expectation
is that consumer service charges will remain approximately 10 percent to 15
percent below 2019 levels in 2021.

Card and ATM Fees

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income
and debit card and ATM related revenue. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019
was primarily due to decreases in bank card and consumer credit card income as
a result of declines in debit and credit card spending and transaction volumes
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Card and ATM fees began to recover late
in 2020 with the expectation that such fees will increase in 2021.

Mortgage Income

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of
residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in
2020 compared to 2019 was due to increased loan production and sales income as
lower interest rates during 2020 drove higher loan application volume. See
Note 7 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial
statements for more information.

Capital Markets Income

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that
includes securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and
placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was
primarily due to increases in fees generated from the placement of permanent
financing for real estate, securities underwriting and placement fees, M&A
advisory services, and positive market-related credit valuation adjustments
tied to credit derivatives within commercial swap income.

Investment Management and Trust Fee Income

Investment management and trust fee income represents income from asset
management services provided to individuals, businesses and institutions. The
increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in assets
under administration and higher sales volumes.

Bank-owned Life Insurance

Bank-owned life insurance increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to
a $25 million gain associated with a policy exchange completed during the
fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by a reduction in claims benefits
during 2020.

Valuation Gain on Equity Investment

Valuation gain on equity investment is associated with an unrealized holding
gain on an equity investment in a company which executed an initial public
offering during the third quarter of 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, at
the end of the 180-day lockup period, Regions executed a trade of all
positions on this equity investment realizing an additional gain of
approximately $3 million.

Securities Gains (Losses), net

Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's
asset/liability management process. The net loss incurred during 2019 was
primarily due to a securities portfolio optimization strategy which included
repositioning MBS. See Table 7 "Debt Securities" section and Note 4 "Debt
Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and
other, are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held
for certain employee benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit
assets - other are offset in salaries and benefits expense. Changes to market
valuation adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 were driven by the overall
performance of the equity markets. Furthermore, the Company repositioned its
defined employee benefits assets portfolio during the second quarter of 2019
into investments that are no longer subject to the volatility of the equity
markets.

Other Miscellaneous Income

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing,
valuation adjustments to equity investments (other than the item referenced
above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous
income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses
resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions
from the investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous
income increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in
additional revenue derived from the Company's April 2020 equipment finance
acquisition, commercial loan related fee income, and commercial leasing income
driven by higher loan balances in 2020.

_______

(1)Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses
presented within net interest income after provision for credit losses is the
sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit
commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded
commitments was included in other non-interest expense.

  

Salaries and Employee Benefits

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation,
long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as
401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as,
expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and
employee benefits increased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to
higher production-based incentives, the addition of associates through the
Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition and annual merit raises
that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. Also contributing to the increase
for 2020 was increased pay related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not occur
in 2019. Full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 19,406 at December 31,
2020 from 19,564 at December 31, 2019, reflecting the continuing impact of the
Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic
priorities which offset the addition of approximately 450 associates from the
April 2020 equipment finance acquisition.

Furniture and Equipment Expense

Furniture and equipment expense includes depreciation, maintenance and
repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of equipment utilized by Regions and
its affiliates. Furniture and equipment expense increased during 2020 compared
to 2019 primarily due to investments in technology.

Net Occupancy Expense

Net occupancy expense includes rent, depreciation, ad valorem taxes,
utilities, insurance, and maintenance. Net occupancy expense decreased during
2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from
the shelter in place orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued
occupancy optimization initiatives which included branch closures and square
footage reductions.

Outside Services

Outside services consists of expenses related to routine services provided by
third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs, data processing, loan
pricing and research, data license purchases, data subscriptions, and check
printing. Outside services decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to
Regions exiting a third party lending relationship in late 2019.

Credit/Checkcard Expenses

Credit/checkcard expenses include credit and checkcard fraud and expenses.
Credit/checkcard expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to
a decline in debit card fraud.

Branch Consolidation, Property and Equipment Charges

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation
adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made.
Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased
branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy
optimization initiatives.

Visa Class B Shares Expense

Visa class B shares expense is associated with shares sold in a prior year.
The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to the finalization of certain
covered litigation. Visa class B shares expense increased during 2020 compared
to 2019 as a result of increases in Visa's stock price and changes in the
status of the covered litigation.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

In the second quarter of 2020, Regions executed a partial tender of two
Regions Bank senior notes due April 2021. In the third quarter of 2020,
Regions redeemed the principal outstanding of two Regions Bank senior notes
due August 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Regions called its 2.75%
Parent senior notes due August 2022. In conjunction with these actions and
early terminations of all FHLB advances, Regions incurred related early
extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $22 million. In 2019, Regions
commenced a tender offer and received tenders for $740 million of its
outstanding 3.20% senior notes due 2021, incurring a related early
extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $16 million. See Note 12
"Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Provision (Credit) for Unfunded Credit Losses

Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses is the adjustment to the reserve
for unfunded credit commitments, which can fluctuate based on the amount of
outstanding commitments and the level of risk associated with those
commitments. Beginning in 2020, adjustments to the reserve for unfunded credit
commitments are included within the provision for credit losses.

Other Miscellaneous Expenses

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications,
postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses,
mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses and other costs (benefits)
related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses decreased
during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower operational losses,
declines in expenses related to non-service related pension costs and lower
expenses associated with limited travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the year ended 2020 was $220 million
compared to income tax expense of $403 million for the same period in 2019,
resulting in effective tax rates of 16.8 percent and 20.3 percent,
respectively. The effective tax rate is lower in 2020 due primarily to a
consistent level of permanent income tax preferences having a proportionally
larger impact relative to pre-tax earnings, which were negatively impacted in
2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable
housing investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest and
nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by
items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-
to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based
payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax
benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between
periods may be impacted.

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL. This resulted in an adjustment
to the opening balance of the allowance. The tax impact of this adjustment
increased deferred tax assets by approximately $126 million. See Note 1
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial
statements for further information.

At December 31, 2020, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of
$505 million compared to a net deferred liability of $328 million at December
31, 2019. The increase in the net deferred tax liability was due principally
to the increase in unrealized gains in derivative instruments and available
for sale securities, which was partially offset by an increase in the deferred
tax asset related to the allowance.

The Company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets
based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and
negative evidence. As part of this evaluative process, the Company considers
the following sources of taxable income: 1) the future reversals of taxable
temporary differences; 2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing
temporary differences and carryforwards; and 3) tax-planning strategies. In
making a conclusion, the Company has evaluated all available positive and
negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income. The primary
sources of evidence impacting the Company's judgment regarding the realization
of its deferred tax assets are summarized below.

61

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

•History of earnings - In 2020, the Company has continued its positive
earnings trend with positive earnings from 2012 through 2020. There is no
history of significant tax carryforwards expiring unused.

•Reversals of taxable temporary differences - The Company anticipates that
future reversals of taxable temporary differences, including the accretion of
taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in a prior
business combination, can absorb up to approximately $1.2 billion of deferred
tax assets, which is significantly larger than the $785 million deferred tax
asset balance net of valuation allowance at December 31, 2020.

•Creation of future taxable income - The Company has projected future taxable
income that could offset excess deferred tax assets.

•Ability to implement tax planning strategies - The Company has the ability to
implement tax planning strategies such as asset sales to maximize the
realization of deferred tax assets.

Based on this evaluative process, the Company established a valuation
allowance in the amount of $31 million at December 31, 2020 and $32 million at
December 31, 2019 because the Company believes that a portion of state net
operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized. See Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information about income
taxes.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On July 2, 2018, Regions sold Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related
affiliates. On April 2, 2012, Morgan Keegan was sold. Regions' results from
discontinued operations are presented in Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" to
the consolidated financial statements. The results from discontinued
operations in 2020 and 2019 were immaterial.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $18.0 billion compared
to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an
increase in cash on deposit with the FRB. Significant deposit growth during
the last half of 2020 contributed to elevated liquidity sources for the
Company. Commercial customer deposit levels significantly increased as
customers brought excess deposits back to Regions. Additionally, consumers
kept government stimulus payments as well as continued to adjust their
spending and saving behavior in response to the economic environment. Regions
deployed some excess liquidity as opportunities existed given market interest
rates, primarily through securities purchases and long-term borrowing
extinguishment activities. See the "Borrowings" and "Securities" sections for
further details. The remaining excess liquidity is held at the FRB. See the
"Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more information.

Debt Securities

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. Regions' investment policy emphasizes credit
quality and liquidity. Debt securities rated in the highest category by
nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S.
Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect
basis, represented approximately 96% percent of the investment portfolio at
December 31, 2020. All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by
the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated
represented approximately 4% percent of total debt securities at December 31,
2020. The "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity Risk" sections,
found later in this report, further explain Regions' interest rate and
liquidity risk management practices.

The average life of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 was
estimated to be 4.59 years, with a duration of approximately 4.0 years. These
metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.3 years, with a duration
of approximately 4.2 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2019.

Despite the low interest rate environment in 2020, Regions' comprehensive
securities repositioning executed in late 2019 positioned the portfolio to
react favorably to the current economic environment. The increase from year-
end 2019 was the result of improved market valuation and purchases of
mortgage-backed securities. During the third quarter of 2020, as part of its
cash deployment strategy, Regions added $2.6 billion of residential agency
mortgage-backed securities and $391 million of commercial agency mortgage-
backed securities.

See Note 4 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

Loans Held For Sale

At December 31, 2020, loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion, consisting of
$1.4 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $460 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $6 million of non-performing loans.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Regions made the decision to sell a certain
portfolio of $239 million commercial and industrial loans, which were
reclassified to held for sale as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019,
loans held for sale totaled $637 million, consisting of $436 million of
residential real estate mortgage loans, $188 million of commercial mortgage
and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. The levels of
residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are
part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on
the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

Loans

GENERAL

Loans, net of unearned income, represented 64 percent of interest-earning
assets as of December 31, 2020, compared to 74 percent as of December 31,
2019. Lending at Regions is generally organized along three portfolio
segments: commercial loans (including commercial and industrial, and owner-
occupied commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans), investor
real estate loans (commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans) and
consumer loans (residential first mortgage, home equity lines and loans,
indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card and other
consumer loans).

(1)Excludes consumer portfolio segment.

(2)Excludes $193 million of small business credit card accounts.

Loans, net of unearned income, totaled $85.3 billion at December 31, 2020, an
increase of $2.3 billion from year-end 2019 levels. Regions manages loan
growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital.
Loan balances increased year over year in the commercial and investor real
estate portfolio segments but decreased in the consumer portfolio segment.
Within the consumer portfolio segment, the year over year balance decline is
attributable to declines across all

categories except for residential first mortgage. Regions' decision in 2019 to
discontinue its indirect auto lending and indirect other businesses
contributed to declines in indirect portfolios.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from the 2019 year-
end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its
loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography
throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to
certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual
borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types
of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See
Note 5 "Loans" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional discussion.

Many classes within Regions' portfolio segments continue to experience the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are
ultimately impacted will be influenced by the duration and severity of the
economic impact, the timely distribution and efficacy of a vaccine, as well as
the effectiveness of the various government stimulus programs in place to
support individuals and businesses. See Tables 11 through 16 below for more
detail.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $2.9 billion or 7 percent since year-end 2019.
This balance includes $3.6 billion of PPP loans and the addition of $1.9
billion in loans related to the Ascentium acquisition that occurred at the
beginning of the second quarter of 2020 (see the "Ascentium Acquisition"
section for more information). In the first half of 2020, the commercial
portfolio experienced elevated draws on commercial lines of credit; however
line utilization levels normalized and declined to historic lows in the second
half of 2020 driven by excess liquidity and customer deleveraging.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business operations. Owner-
occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following table provides detail of Regions' commercial portfolio balances
in selected industries as of December 31:

_______

(1)"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted.

  

Regions has identified certain industry sectors within the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to
COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the fourth quarter of 2020,
which narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to the third and second
quarters. As of December 31, 2020, these high-risk industries include energy,
healthcare, consumer services and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels.
Industries identified as high-risk may change in future periods depending on
how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over time. These
identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within these
industries, are detailed in Table 12 below. PPP loan balances are not included
in Table 12 as these loans are not considered high risk, as they are fully
guaranteed by the U.S government. Regions is closely monitoring customers in
these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers. Certain of
these exposures are also represented in Table 12 through Table 16 below. All
loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless
specifically identified as IRE.

Energy

Regions' direct energy portfolio is comprised mostly of E&P and midstream
sector borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, oil prices have rebounded from all-
time lows in April 2020, but have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels. None of
Regions' direct energy credits are leveraged loans and Regions has no second
lien energy exposure. Throughout 2020, Regions recognized approximately $136
million in energy charge-offs, of which 83% is associated with loans
originated prior to 2016 and were unable to restructure after the 2015
downturn. Since first quarter 2015, utilization rates have remained between
40-60%. Hedge positions are adequate for oil producers and strong for natural
gas providers, and less than one percent of energy loans are currently
operating under a COVID-19 payment deferral.

Restaurant

The quick service sector comprises over half of Regions' restaurant portfolio
balances outstanding. Quarantining, social distancing, and reduced business
travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to result in
lost demand, much of which may not be recoverable. The $705 million in COVID
high-risk balances disclosed in Table 12 above include loans in the quick
service, casual dining and other sectors disclosed in Table 14 below. Casual
dining is the sector under the most stress in the current environment. While
the quick service sector does include COVID high risk loans, they represent a
smaller portion of the sector's total outstanding balance compared to other
restaurant sectors. The quick service restaurants focus on fast food service
and limited menus, and have performed relatively well during the pandemic
given their digital platforms, drive-through and delivery capabilities.
Approximately 19% of restaurant outstandings are leveraged. Prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic, Regions strategically exited some higher risk restaurant
relationships at par. Less than one percent of restaurant, accommodation and
lodging portfolio balances are in payment deferrals as of December 31, 2020.
During 2020, Regions has recognized approximately $40 million in restaurant
charge-offs.

Hotel-related

Regions' hotel-related portfolio is the most impacted property type given
cancellations of events, conventions, and most business and leisure travel.
While demand is expected to increase in 2021, the average daily rate will
likely be slower to recover. Regions' hotel-related portfolio is primarily
comprised of 11 REIT customers. These loans are unsecured commercial and
industrial loans; however, they are real estate related. The REIT portfolio
benefits from low leverage, strong liquidity, and diversity of property
holdings. Companies have also taken proactive steps to reduce capital
expenditures, cut dividends, and reduce overhead to preserve cash. SNCs
comprise 55% of Regions' total hotel-related loans. As noted above, less than
one percent of restaurant, accommodation and lodging portfolio balances are in
payment deferrals as of December 31, 2020. The consumer services and PPP
balances included in the table below along with the total restaurants balance
in Table 14 above comprise the restaurant, accommodation and lodging balance
in Table 11 above.

Retail-related

Regions' retail-related industry is primarily comprised of REITs and non-
leveraged commercial and industrial sectors. Approximately $319 million of
outstanding balances across the REIT and IRE portfolios relate to shopping
malls and outlet centers. Portfolio exposure to REITs specializing in enclosed
malls consists of a small number of credits. Approximately 30% of mall REIT
balances are investment grade with low leverage. The IRE portfolio is widely
distributed. The largest tenants typically include "basic needs" anchors. The
commercial and industrial retail portfolio is also widely distributed. The
largest categories include motor vehicle and parts dealers, gasoline stations,
building materials, garden equipment and supplies, and non-store retailers.
Owner-occupied CRE consists primarily of small strip malls and convenience
stores which are largely term loans where a higher utilization rate is
expected. Less than one percent of retail trade and retail only lending is
operating in a deferral as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, Regions has
recognized approximately $13 million in retail-related lending charge-offs.
The commercial and industrial leveraged and non-leveraged, asset-based
lending, PPP and CRE owner-occupied balances totaling $2.6 billion in the
table below comprise the retail trade commercial industry sector balance in

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $706 million in comparison to 2019 year-
end balances reflecting new fundings and draws on investor real estate
construction lines.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $2.1 billion in comparison to 2019 year-end balances.
The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an
increase in originations due to historically low market interest rates during
2020. Approximately $7.2 billion in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the year ended December 31, 2020.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $761 million in comparison to 2019 year-end
balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions'
branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home
equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment
upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity.
The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments required
until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of
December 31, 2020. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines
with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert
to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans
decreased by $371 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio decreased $878 million from year-end 2019. The
decrease was due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the
fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue
its indirect auto lending business. The Company remains in the direct auto
lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through
third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio class decreased
$818 million from year-end 2019 due to exiting a third party relationship
during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $174 million from
year-end 2019 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as customers
reacted to the economic environment.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $227 million from year-
end 2019.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit
Losses".

Allowance

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments
includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding
unfunded loan commitments.

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss
allowance methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. See Note 1
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", Note 5 "Loans", Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses"and Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and
Restrictions" for information about CECL adoption, areas of judgment and
methodologies used in establishing the allowance.

Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, Regions has increased the
allowance by $878 million from $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion as of December 31,
2020, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the
life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change
in the allowance are presented in Table 19 below. While many of these items
overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

(1)Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and
recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a
reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets. See
Note 1 for additional details.

(2)Portfolio growth does not include PPP loans of $3.6 billion, $4.6 billion
and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30,
2020, respectively, which are fully backed by the U.S. government and have an
immaterial associated allowance.

(3)This balance includes $64 million related to the initial allowance for non-
PCD loans acquired as part of the second quarter 2020 Ascentium acquisition.

  

The 2020 allowance was impacted by the economic conditions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In the first half of 2020, the economic environment showed
signs of deterioration in reaction to the public health crisis. While the
second half of 2020 showed signs of economic improvement and stabilization,
there continues to be uncertainty surrounding the economic environment due to
the status of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit metrics improved during the fourth
quarter, and deferrals and forbearance balances declined. Additionally,
stimulus continues to work its way through the economic system, as evidenced
by a moderate increase in consumer spend later in 2020. While economic growth
improved and vaccines were approved for distribution in the fourth quarter of
2020, the public health crisis is not resolved and continued economic
uncertainty remains. While the initial economic stimulus for those on
unemployment expired in the third quarter of 2020, an additional stimulus
package was approved in the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, mortgage
LTVs are holding up well and the HPI showed robust appreciation. As the credit
risk within Regions' loan portfolio continues to be evaluated, both negative
and positive factors of the ever-evolving economic landscape were considered
in determining the allowance as of year-end.

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the year in order to understand
external macro-views of credit metrics, trends and industry outlooks as well
as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The fourth
quarter of 2020 exhibited improving credit metrics as economic conditions
stabilized. While commercial and investor real estate criticized balances
increased approximately $66 million, classified balances decreased $326
million compared to the third quarter. Non-performing

loans excluding held for sale decreased $22 million compared to the third
quarter. Additionally net charge-offs decreased $19 million during the fourth
quarter. Regions performed a bottom-up review of commercial and IRE loan
portfolios during the fourth quarter, which resulted in fewer sectors
considered high-risk compared to the third quarter. Approximately $5.2 billion
of commercial and investor real estate loans are in COVID-19 high-risk
industry segments or are considered COVID-19 at-risk-assets. These high-risk
industries include energy, healthcare, consumer services and travel, retail,
restaurants, and hotels. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for
more information about the high-risk industries.

Regions purchased Ascentium, an independent equipment financing company on
April 1, 2020. The purchase included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and
leases to small businesses, of which approximately 46% were considered to be
PCD. Regions considered loan payment status, COVID-19 deferral status, and
loans in high-risk industries in COVID-19 highly-impacted states in its
determination of PCD. The Ascentium acquisition resulted in $136 million in
additional allowance in the second quarter, of which $76 million was recorded
through the provision for credit losses and the remaining $60 million was for
acquired PCD loans and did not impact the provision for credit losses. See the
"Ascentium Acquisition" section for more information.

Changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the
allowance estimate under CECL. Regions' economic forecast utilized in the
January 1, 2020 allowance upon adoption of CECL considered a relatively benign
economic environment. The forecast utilized in the March 31, 2020 allowance
considered a more stressed economic environment due to the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic based on early stage pandemic information. The economic
forecast utilized in the June 30, 2020 allowance included further
deterioration primarily due to higher levels of unemployment. The economic
forecast utilized in the September 30, 2020 allowance included normalization
of economic activity, albeit at an uneven pace across individual states and
industry groups. The economic forecast used in the December 31, 2020 allowance
included stabilizing economic conditions. Refer to the "Economic Environment
in Regions' Banking Markets" section for more information. Regions benchmarked
its internal forecast with external forecasts and available external data.

Risks to the economic forecasts included a high degree of uncertainty around
how wide the COVID-19 pandemic could spread, how long it could persist, and if
any public health changes could trigger another round of shutdowns. However,
the development of vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2020 and passage of an
additional round of stimulus are positive signs. The CECL model produced
unintuitive results in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the
transient spike in unemployment rates. In the third quarter of 2020,
unemployment levels normalized, but remained elevated, and the CECL models
reacted directionally as expected. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the modeled
results acted directionally consistent with the updated forecast reflecting
improving economic conditions and resulted in a decline to modeled results. In
consideration of economic uncertainty, several points of analysis including
spikes in unemployment rates, stress analyses on industries most acutely
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain other loan portfolio-specific
adjustments were considered and resulted in model adjustments to partially
offset the reduction in modeled results. Refer to the "Portfolio
Characteristics" section for more information about COVID-19 impacted
industries.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The December 31, 2020 general imprecision
allowance considered incremental risks of the current economic environment
including uncertainty specific to COVID-19, vaccine distribution, future
government assistance and consumer spending. A key consideration for the
commercial models' general imprecision was the continued impacts of spikes in
variables other than unemployment rates. Additionally, general imprecision was
considered for certain consumer models that are not economically conditioned
and as such do not fully consider these risks.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of December 31, 2020. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$2.3 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of December 31, 2020.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 21 "Allowance
for Credit Losses". As noted, economic trends such as interest rates,
unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well
as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the CARES Act
and other policy accommodations, and the timely distribution and efficacy of a
vaccine will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in
volatility of certain credit metrics during 2021 and beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. As provided in the CARES Act passed into
law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19
pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the end
of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 were eligible for relief from TDR
classification. Regions elected this provision of the CARES Act; therefore,
modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered
TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below. Further, on December 27,
2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law and extended the
relief from TDR classification through the earlier of 60 days after the
national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends or January 1, 2022.
Regions elected this provision.

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments
are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. Upon expiration of the
deferral period, customers may apply for additional relief or resume making
payments on their loans. Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on
the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower. The CARES Act relief and
short-term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded the majority of these
modifications from being classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2020. See "The
Executive Overview" section for additional details on deferrals as of December
31, 2020.

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other
consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and
investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal
program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a
workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real
estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate
is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market.
Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information
is included in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated
financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and
related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods ending
December 31:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements,
Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely
achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to
continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

(1)Excludes accruing loans 90 days past due.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but
not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed
loans excluded were $57 million at December 31, 2020, $66 million at December
31, 2019, $84 million at December 31, 2018, $124 million at December 31, 2017
and $113 million at December 31, 2016.

Non-performing loans increased during 2020 primarily driven by downgrades in
the commercial and industrial and the commercial investor real estate mortgage
classes. Retail IRE and restaurant sectors within these classes have
experienced stress due to recent declines in demand brought on by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

At December 31, 2020, Regions estimates that the amount of commercial and
investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual
status for the next quarter is within the range of $135 million to $225
million.

In order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the
next quarter, credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may
potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending upon the
occurrence of future events. A variety of factors are included in the
assessment of potential problem loans, including a borrower's capacity and
willingness to meet contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments
or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and
complete financial information, including global cash flows, contingent
liabilities and sources of liquidity. For other loans (for example, smaller
dollar loans), a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate
of potential future downgrades. In addition, the economic environment and
industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of
potential problem loans for the next quarter. Current trends will additionally
influence the size of the estimated range. Because of the inherent uncertainty
in forecasting future events, the estimated range of potential problem loans
ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans, as
opposed to an individual listing of loans.

Many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are
considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard
accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans
held for sale) by portfolio segment:

Other Earning Assets

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB and FHLB stock,
marketable equity securities and operating lease assets. The balance at
December 31, 2020 totaled $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion at December
31, 2019. Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at
December 31, 2019. Refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section earlier
in this report for detailed discussions of the Company's methodology for
testing goodwill for impairment. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" and Note 10 "Intangible Assets" to the consolidated
financial statements for the methodologies and assumptions used in the
goodwill impairment analysis.

Deposits

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations and hours for its
customers, all while trying to keep branch employees safe during the COVID-19
pandemic. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-
quality banking services and the Company's digital channels and contact
center.

Deposits are Regions' primary source of funds, providing funding for 90
percent of average earning assets in 2020 and 86 percent of average earning
assets in 2019. Table 27 "Deposits" details year-over-year deposits on a
period-ending basis. Total deposits at December 31, 2020 increased
approximately $25.0 billion compared to year-end 2019 levels. The increase in
deposits was primarily driven by increases in non-interest-bearing demand,
interest-bearing transaction, savings and money market categories. These
increases were partially offset by decreases in customer time deposits and
corporate treasury other deposits.

Deposit costs decreased to 16 basis points for 2020, compared to 47 basis
points for 2019 and 26 basis points for 2018. The rate paid on interest-
bearing deposits decreased to 0.27 percent in 2020 compared to 0.74 percent
for 2019 and 0.42 percent for 2018. The decrease in the rate paid on interest-
bearing deposits during 2020 is largely due to the decline of short-term
interest rates. Low deposit costs are driven primarily by the composition of
the Company's deposit base, which includes a significant amount of low-cost
and relatively small account balance consumer and private wealth deposits. The
deposit base composition is a key component of the Company's franchise value.

The following table summarizes deposits by category as of December 31:

Table 27--Deposits

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | | |  
Time deposits| 5,341 | | | 7,442 | | | 7,122 | | | | |  
Customer deposits| 122,468 | | | 95,567 | | | 94,249 | | | | |  
Corporate treasury time deposits| 11 | | | 108 | | | 242 | | | | |

| $| 122,479 | | | $| 97,475 | | | $| 94,491 | | | | |  
  
Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $17.2 billion to $51.3 billion
at year-end 2020 due primarily to consumer reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic
which has impacted customer liquidity levels. Customers have chosen to keep
excess funds from government stimulus programs. Corporate customers
consolidated sources of liquidity and brought cash balances back to Regions.
Also, businesses are focused on supply chain efficiencies and turnover of
receivables which has increased their cash levels and resulting deposits. Non-
interest-bearing demand deposits accounted for approximately 42 percent of
total deposits for 2020 compared to 35 percent for 2019.

Interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $4.4 billion to $24.5 billion
and money market accounts increased $4.4 billion to $29.7 billion at year-end
2020. Interest-bearing transaction deposits accounted for approximately 20
percent of total deposits for 2020 compared to 21 percent for 2019. Money
market accounts accounted for approximately 24 percent of total deposits at
year-end 2020 compared to 26 percent at year end 2019. A large driver of the
increase in interest-bearing transaction and money market balances was due to
customers choosing to keep excess cash from government stimulus, as discussed
above. Additionally, lower consumer spend in response to the economic
environment contributed to deposit growth.

Included in time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual
retirement accounts. Customer time deposits decreased $2.1 billion to $5.3
billion at year-end 2020 due to maturities and continued lower interest rates
resulting in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts throughout
2020. Time deposits accounted for 4 percent and 8 percent of total deposits in
2020 and 2019, respectively. See Table 28 "Maturity of Time Deposits of
$100,000 or More" for maturity information.

Corporate treasury other deposits decreased as these deposits were used to
supplement incremental balance sheet funding at year-end 2019, but not
utilized during 2020.

Borrowings

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, totaled zero at
December 31, 2020 compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The levels of
these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and
the sources utilized. FHLB advances decreased in 2020 as the increase in
deposits reduced the need for short-term funding from the FHLB.

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions' funding strategy.
The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances
continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity"
section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-Term Borrowings

Total long-term borrowings decreased approximately $4.3 billion to $3.6
billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.5 billion
decrease in FHLB advances. The increase in deposits also reduced the need for
long-term borrowings from the FHLB. Additionally, Regions executed partial
tenders and redeemed senior notes in their entirety. The issuance of $750
million of senior notes due 2025 was a partial offset to the tenders and
redemptions. The overall decrease was also partially offset by the Ascentium
acquisition, through which Regions acquired securitized borrowings, which the
Company will manage within its broader liability management process and in
line with the allowable terms of the contracts.

See Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of both short-term and long-term borrowings.

N/A - not applicable.

On April 3, 2020 Moody's revised outlooks for Regions Bank and Regions
Financial Corporation to stable from positive citing expectations for a
contracting economy in 2020 which is expected to have a direct negative impact
on U.S. banks' asset quality and profitability.

On April 9, 2020 Fitch revised outlooks for Regions Financial Corporation to
stable from positive as part of an overall revision of its U.S. bank sector
and rating outlook. Revision to the overall outlook was driven by concerns
over the negative financial and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more
information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

Shareholders' Equity

Shareholders' equity was $18.1 billion at December 31, 2020 as compared to
$16.3 billion at December 31, 2019. During 2020, net income increased
shareholders' equity by $1.1 billion. Cash dividends on common stock and cash
dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $595 million and
$103 million, respectively. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income
increased shareholders' equity by $1.4 billion, primarily due to the net
change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during
2020. The cumulative effect from the adoption of CECL decreased shareholders'
equity by $377 million. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" for information about the CECL adoption. Lastly, during the second
quarter of 2020, the Company issued Series D preferred stock, which increased
shareholders' equity by $346 million.

See Note 15 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CAPITAL RULES

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. See Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the applicable
holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. The Basel III Rules are now fully phased in, and among other things, (i)
impose a capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital
consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting specified
requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most
deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not
to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the
deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. The Basel
III Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weightings of assets
and off-balance sheet exposures to derive the capital ratios.

84

Table of Contents

  

  

  

The Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to
CET1. For example, goodwill and selected other intangible assets, and
disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted. MSRs, certain other deferred tax
assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are
also deducted from CET1 if they exceed defined thresholds. Under the Basel III
Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are
included; however, standardized approach banking organizations, including
Regions and Regions Bank, were allowed to make a one-time permanent election
to exclude these items. Regions and Regions Bank made this election in order
to avoid significant variations in the level of capital, including the impact
of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities
portfolios.

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year
period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over the
following three years. The addback is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At
December 31, 2020, the impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $582
million, or approximately 54 basis points.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as
the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the
standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these
standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk
(including by recalibrating risk-weights and introducing new capital
requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as
unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach
for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will
generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor
phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules,
operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to
advanced approach institutions, and not to Regions or Regions Bank. The impact
of Basel IV on the Company will depend on the manner in which it is
implemented by the federal banking regulators.

In October of 2020, the SCB framework that was finalized in the first quarter
of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk
sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help
determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5
percent to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result
of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the Capital
Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5 percent in addition to the minimum
risk-weighted asset ratios shown in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements
and Restrictions".

During the third quarter, and in connection with the results of its
supervisory stress test released in June 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized
Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third
quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the
amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario,
inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. In December
2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed the results of its supervisory stress test
associated with the capital plan resubmission. While the Federal Reserve did
not recalibrate SCBs as a part of the resubmission for participating banks,
Regions' implied SCB would have been floored at 2.5 percent based on capital
degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario had the SCB been
updated. Although the decision to update SCB requirements based on the
resubmission results was deferred, the Federal Reserve may decide at any point
through March 31, 2021 to update Regions' and other firms' SCB requirement
based on the results.

EGRRCPA was enacted on May 24, 2018, and makes limited amendments to the Dodd-
Frank Act as well as modifications to other post-crisis regulatory
requirements. As a result of EGRRCPA, Regions is no longer subject to company-
run stress testing requirements and changes Regions' supervisory stress
testing cycle from annual to biennial. In October 2019, the federal banking
agencies finalized rules that would tailor the application of enhanced
prudential standards per the EGRRCPA and would assign each institution with
$100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as its bank
subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and five risk-based
indicators. Regions is a "Category IV" institution. Broader discussion of the
impact of EGRRCPA on Regions and Regions Bank is included under the
"Supervision and Regulation" section of the "Business" section of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules and their applicability to
Regions is included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and
Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements. Discussion of the
final rule to provide relief for the initial capital decrease at adoption of
CECL is included in the "Risk Factors" section and in Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt
and equity. See Note 2 "Variable Interest Entities" to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion.

Regions' off-balance sheet credit risk includes obligations for loans sold
with recourse, unfunded loan commitments, and letters of credit. See Note 7
"Servicing of Financial Assets" and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary
in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most
commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in
fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the
implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of
total assets in the banking industry and the resulting level of
capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and
therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.

Management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on
financial results is a direct result of Regions' ability to manage the impact
of changes in interest rates. The Company was modestly asset sensitive as of
December 31, 2020, primarily driven by exposure to middle and long term rates
from future fixed-rate business originations. However, recent hedging activity
has reduced the exposure to net interest income and other financing income due
to changes in short-term interest rates. Regions' hedging strategy is designed
to protect net interest income and net interest margin against a continued low
short-term interest rate environment. Refer to Table 30 "Interest Rate
Sensitivity" for additional details on Regions' interest rate sensitivity.

EFFECTS OF DEFLATION

A period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial
institutions. Potentially, deflation could lead to lower profits, higher
unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic
conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair
bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product
pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans.

Management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on
financial results relates to Regions' ability to maintain a sufficient amount
of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses.
However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it
maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to
develop.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of
operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that
comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that
apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk
management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the
achievement of the Company's strategic objectives.

The primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company's risk
management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational
risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.

•Market risk is the risk to the Company's financial condition resulting from
adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign
exchange rates or equity prices.

•Liquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its
obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or
obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the
potential that the Company cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures
without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market
depth or market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk").

•Credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or
counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.

•Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.

•Legal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet
Regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual
perspectives.

•Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital
arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-
conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or
ethical standards.

86

•Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the
Company's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the
customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.

•Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and
resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and
operating environment.

Several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the
remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Regions' risk management framework outlines the Company's approach for
managing risk that includes the following four components:

•Collaborative Risk Culture \- A strong, collaborative risk culture is
fundamental to the Company's core values and operating principles. It ensures
focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and
behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking
within the bounds of the Company's risk appetite. The Company's risk culture
requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged;
thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the Company. Sustaining a
collaborative risk culture is critical to the Company's success and is a clear
expectation of executive management and the Board.

•Sound Risk Appetite \- The Company's risk appetite statements define the
types and levels of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its
objectives.

•Sustainable Risk Processes \- Effective risk management requires sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report risk.

•Responsible Risk Governance \- Governance serves as the foundation for
comprehensive management of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear
responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and
reporting both existing and emerging risks.

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective
management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company's
approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense
concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company.

•1st Line of Defense activities provide for the identification, acceptance and
ownership of risks.

•2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the
Company's risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company's aggregate
risk levels.

•3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and
assessments of risk management practices across the Company.

The Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The
principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for
evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial
reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated
an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's
establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and
procedures over financial reporting. See the "Financial Disclosures and
Internal Controls" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for
additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of
outside directors to focus on Regions' overall risk profile. The Risk
Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that
reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including
quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk
type. This statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the
tone for the Board's risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the
Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By
establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by
incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers
and other stakeholders, the Company's risk appetite is aligned with its
strategic priorities and goals.

The Risk Management Group, led by the Company's Chief Risk Officer, ensures
the consistent application of Regions' risk management approach within the
structure of the Company's operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary
activities of the Risk Management Group include:

•Interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues
for the Company;

•Identifying risks and determining which Company areas and/or products will be
affected;

•Ensuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks
will affect the Company as a whole and the individual area and or product;

•Assisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring Company areas have
appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and

87

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

•Reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure
the continued appropriateness of risk controls.

As part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes
recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding
adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In
addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of
the Company's internal control structure and related systems and processes.

Management, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal
process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each
business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated,
as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The
Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are
within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement.

Some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and
control risks are described in the remainder of this report. External factors
beyond management's control may result in losses despite the Risk Management
Group's efforts.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company also focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most
yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based
on historical minimums as explained in the following section. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of December 31, 2020, Regions was
asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts
as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending December 2021.
The fourth quarter continued the trend of strong balance sheet growth in low-
cost deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. These trends
increase reported asset sensitivity levels in the near-term assuming modest
deposit normalization. Given the uncertainty surrounding balance sheet
liquidity in the current environment, interest rate risk under various deposit
scenarios is explored in more detail later in this section.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. A decline in short-term interest rates (such as
the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR)
will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied
to such rates. Under that environment, it is expected that declines in funding
costs and increases in balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the
decline in asset yields. Therefore, net interest income sensitivity to short-
term rates is approximately neutral in a falling rate scenario. An increase in
short-term rates will result in an increase in net interest income, though
this is largely due to elevated deposit balances resulting from outsized
growth in 2020. Net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve
tenors. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as
intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will
drive yields higher on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans,
increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and
reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the
investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment where
intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. All forward starting
hedges were due to become active in January 2021. More information regarding
forward starting hedges is disclosed in Table 31 and its accompanying
description.

________

(1)Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12 month forward
looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases
and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.

(2)All cash flow hedges transacted are now fully reflected within the
measurement horizon (see Table 32 for additional information regarding hedge
start and maturity dates).

(3)The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12 month average rate
shock of -13 basis points and -99 basis points to approximately zero for 1
month LIBOR and the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield, respectively. Mortgage yield
shocks are floored at their historical minimums -35 basis points.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
35 basis points lower than the historical all-time minimum. Recent market
volatility and new historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors
have resulted in a shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to
approximately zero. Mortgage rates, which have retained somewhat elevated
levels, are still being shocked in the manner previously described. Further,
the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates. The falling rate
scenarios in Table 30 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and
instantaneous shocks under this environment.

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table
30 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the
progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the
scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there
are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan and deposit
projections reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of deposits in
response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of
prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on management's
expectations in the current environment. In the base case scenario and falling
rate scenarios in Table 30, interest-bearing deposit rates move into the
single digits. The deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate
level and time. Currently, the gradual +100 basis point, parallel interest
rate shock scenario outlined above includes an approximately 20% to 25%
interest-bearing deposit beta. Deposit pricing outperformance or
underperformance of 5% in that scenario would increase or decrease net
interest income by $26 million, respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits
will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles.
Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest
bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is
rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12 months in the
gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 30. Since the end of 2019, Regions
has seen sizable deposit growth, which has contributed to its higher interest
rate risk sensitivity year-to-date. The Company estimates that every $5
billion decline in total deposit balances would reduce NII sensitivity in
Table 30 by approximately -$35 million and +$12 million in the gradual +100
basis point and the gradual -100 basis point floored shock scenarios,
respectively. While estimates should be used as a guide, differences may
result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market competitive
factors.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a
predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are
executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives
to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its
mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the
origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the
potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect
the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in
interest rates and pricing.

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives
traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in this
report contains more information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.

See Note 21 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' year-end
derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR Transition--In 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that
panel banks will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to
construct LIBOR by the end of 2021, confirming that the continuation of LIBOR
will not be guaranteed beyond that date. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the
FCA, in coordination with ICE Benchmark Administration and the Federal Reserve
announced a consultation process that could potentially amend the LIBOR
cessation date. If the consultation is finalized as proposed, the LIBOR
cessation date would be modified to June 30, 2023 for most rate tenors.
Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of
LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate
obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark
rate. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes
dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant business lines and support
groups engaged. As part of this program, the Company continues to identify,
assess, and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation, unavailability,
or non-representativeness of LIBOR. While significant uncertainty remains,
steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by
Regions' Executive LIBOR Steering Committee. Regions is also coordinating with
regulatory agencies and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative
rates

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
institutions.

91

Table of Contents

  

  

  

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the official
sector and Government-Sponsored Enterprises.

Regions has also continued to evaluate its financial and operational
infrastructure, and continued its efforts to transition all financial and
strategic processes, systems, and models; and implemented processes to
coordinate communications with customers. In the third quarter of 2020,
Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that
reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to
the consolidated financial statements for details.

MARKET RISK--PREPAYMENT RISK

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment
speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments.
Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net
interest income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be
prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower
rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate
environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets.
Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions' interest income
and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these
assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not
having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also
impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions'
greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed
securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the
residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements.
Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which
are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in
policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S.
Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage
market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing
dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may
be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and
manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all
such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk
that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income
on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part
of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk
management.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. Regions maintains strong liquidity levels that
position the Company to respond to stressed environments. As discussed below,
Regions has a variety of liquidity sources, which it continues to utilize to
fund customer needs.

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the
economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the
establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the
PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its
customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending
institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company
through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, Regions had not used the Paycheck Protection Program
Liquidity Facility.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential
litigation contingencies. See Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders' equity. Regions' goal in liquidity
management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs in
normal and stressed conditions. Having and using various sources of liquidity
to satisfy the Company's funding requirements is important.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions
performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at
the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy
requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater
of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash
balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company
totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Compliance with the holding company
cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a
quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank
and subsidiaries. These minimum requirements are informed by internal stress
testing measures which are reflective of Regions' portfolio and business mix.
The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any
reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established by the
Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's
Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 4 "Debt
Securities" to the

92

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured
borrowing capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions'
liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base.
Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money
markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured
sources of funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At December 31, 2020,
Regions had approximately $16.4 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an
increase from approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019, due to the
significant increase in deposits associated with government programs offered
in relation to COVID-19. The average balance held with the FRB was
approximately $7.7 billion and $666 million during 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for more
information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of December 31, 2020, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $12.8 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, Regions
had no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $16.2 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain
eligible securities and loans as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances.
Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of
outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a
reliable and economical source of funding. Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning
Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

Regions' contractual obligations and expected payment dates are presented in

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section
found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk
characteristics of each loan type. See further discussion of the current U.S.
economic environment in the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets"
section and counterparty risk below.

Management Process

Credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout
all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken
are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite. The credit quality of
borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings;
however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses
which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and
consumer lending. Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset
quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a
structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. Credit
policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and
adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies
guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and
provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.

Effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification,
measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure,
credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented
a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to
the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.

Occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations
and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. Teams are in place
to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan
modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for
credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in
the portfolio.

For a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the
allowance for credit losses refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates and
Related Policies" section found earlier in this report, and Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to
the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for
credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year's
total, are included in Table 21 "Allowance for Credit Losses". Also, refer to
Table 22 "Allowance Allocation" for details pertaining to management's
allocation of the allowance to each loan category.

Responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks,
including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line
of defense. Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses
and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of
defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a third
line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions'
activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk
profile of the Company.

Counterparty Risk

Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or
contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal
obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial
bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client.

Regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of
counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible
for the independent credit risk management of financial institution
counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for
the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate
and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk
management of client side counterparties.

Financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types
generated in one or more departments of the Company. Aggregate exposure limits
are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the
Company. Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk
management product to hedge risks in the client's business. Exposures to
counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to
senior management.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security
risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks
that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, increase in
technology-based products and services used by

94

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

us and our customers, the growing use of mobile devices and cloud
technologies, the ability to conduct more financial transactions online, and
the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers,
terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on
the part of employees.

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify
and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its
information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and
vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems
and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls
are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and
transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing
practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure
its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the
resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue
to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to
evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or
unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a
comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and
oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from
outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment
has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

Regions' system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide
protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security
matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient
resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively
engaged in the oversight of Regions' continuous efforts to reinforce and
enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their
oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security
threat landscape. The Board monitors Regions' information management risk
policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee, which oversees
areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks
associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and
oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments,
strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity,
and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board's Audit Committee
regularly reviews Regions' cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving
reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the Chief
Information Security Officer, Risk Management, and Internal Audit. The Board
annually reviews the information security program and, through its various
committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters.

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to
gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions
to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is
a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services
sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third
party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability
and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so
information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to
other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC,
Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its
members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and
fraud topics.

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation.
These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions
in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant
resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these
measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure,
Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading
consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also
developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans
that it could implement in the event of a cyber event to mitigate the effects
of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. Some of Regions'
financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by
applicable insurance.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations
and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of
its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and
monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions'
reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event.

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

Regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally
include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Regions' process for evaluating
internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks
facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or
mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are
in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools
are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the
internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places
responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure
that controls are effective.

Regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and
procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC
are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information
required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information
is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Regions' Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the
legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and
treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external
events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in
reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with
the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from
accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC
Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose
to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in Regions' internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company's
Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete and timely. As part of this
process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from
Regions' associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring
effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are
reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company's
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is
presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and
the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and
other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a
quarterly basis.

As required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO
and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions'
periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of
disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial
reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the
previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and
makes refinements as necessary.

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance
company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to
increase business loans and leases to small business customers using
Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities.

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of
assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired,
$1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial
and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were
long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of
the borrowings, and as of December 31, 2020, $97 million of long-term debt
remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair value.

These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of December 31, 2020.
Fair value estimates, including loans, intangible assets and goodwill, are
subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional
information becomes available.

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on
the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered
to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price
less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is
recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition,
which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related
to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset
value as part of the acquisition.

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value
mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the
contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The
amortization will not be material.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions recognized goodwill of $345
million and other intangible assets of $47 million. Intangible assets are
comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other intangibles. Intangible
assets will be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized
asset.

Item 8\. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of the Management of Regions Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries (the "Company"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. Regions' internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and
actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

All internal controls systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements in the Company's
financial statements, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding
of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Regions' management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in its 2013 Internal Control
--Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe and assert that,
as of December 31, 2020, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Regions' independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit
report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. This report appears on the following page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial
Corporation

  

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). In our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes of the Company and our
report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.

  

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial
Corporation

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regions
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020
and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and
our report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses in 2020 due to the
adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. As explained below, auditing the Company's allowance for credit
losses, including the adoption of the new accounting guidance, was a critical
audit matter.

  

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to
which it relates.

| | Allowance for credit losses  
Description of the Matter| |

The allowance for credit losses consists of two components: the allowance for
loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2020,
the allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $2.3 billion. The provision for
credit losses was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As
discussed above and in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted new accounting guidance related
to the estimate of the ACL, resulting in an ACL increase of $501 million. The
ACL is established to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life
of the loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments.
Management's measurement of expected losses is driven by loss forecasting
models which utilize relevant quantitative information about historical
experience, current conditions and the reasonable and supportable economic
forecast that affects the collectability of the reported amount. Management's
estimate for the expected credit losses is established through these
quantitative factors, as well as qualitative considerations to account for the
imprecision inherent in the estimation process. As a result, management may
adjust the ACL for the potential impact of qualitative factors through their
established framework. Management's qualitative framework provides for
specific model and general imprecision adjustments for such factors as the
economic forecast imprecision, potential model error imprecision, process
imprecision and specific issues or events that Management believes are not
adequately captured in the modeled outcomes.

  

Auditing management's ACL estimate and related provision for credit losses
involved a high degree of complexity in evaluating the expected loss
forecasting models and subjectivity in evaluating management's measurement of
the economic forecast used during the reasonable and supportable period and
the qualitative factors.  
  
| |  
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit| | We obtained an understanding,
evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's
process for establishing the ACL, including management's controls over: 1)
expected loss forecasting models including model validation, implementation,
monitoring, the completeness and accuracy of key inputs and assumptions used
in the models; 2) the development and application of the reasonable and
supportable economic forecast; 3) the identification and measurement of
qualitative factors.  
  
With respect to expected loss forecasting models, with the support of
specialists, we evaluated the conceptual soundness of the model methodology
and re-performed the calculation for a sample of models. We also tested the
appropriateness of key inputs and assumptions used in these models by agreeing
a sample of inputs to supporting information.  
  
Regarding the reasonable and supportable economic forecast, with the support
of specialists, we assessed the forecasted economic scenario by, among other
procedures, evaluating management's methodology for developing the forecast
and comparing a sample of key economic variables developed to external
sources, historical and peer bank information.  
  
With respect to the identification of qualitative factors, we evaluated 1) the
potential impact of imprecision in the quantitative models and hence the need
to consider a qualitative adjustment to the ACL, and 2) changes, assumptions
and adjustments to the models. Regarding measurement of the qualitative
factors, we evaluated internal data utilized by management to estimate the
appropriate level of the qualitative factors, as well as internal data
produced by the Company's Credit Review, Internal Audit and Model Validation
groups, and external macroeconomic factors independently obtained during the
audit.  
  
We evaluated the overall ACL amount, including model estimates and qualitative
factor adjustments, and whether the recorded ACL appropriately reflects
expected credit losses on the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments.
We reviewed historical loss statistics, peer-bank information, subsequent
events and transactions and considered whether they corroborate or contradict
the Company's measurement of the ACL.

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions" or the "Company") provides a full
range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the
South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial
institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other
adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain of those regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the periods
presented. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used
in the consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to, the
estimates and assumptions related to the allowance for credit losses, fair
value measurements, intangibles, residential MSRs and income taxes.

Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and
disclosure through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During 2020, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to several
topics, including CECL. The cumulative effect of the modified retrospective
application of CECL on retained earnings is discussed below. All prior period
amounts impacted by guidance that required retrospective application have been
revised.

Certain amounts in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation, except as otherwise noted. These
reclassifications are immaterial and have no effect on net income,
comprehensive income (loss), total assets or total shareholders' equity as
previously reported.

CECL

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL, which replaces the incurred loss
methodology with an expected loss methodology. The measurement of expected
losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized
cost, including loan receivables and debt securities held to maturity. It also
applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance
(loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other
similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in
accordance with accounting guidance on leases. In addition, CECL required
changes to the accounting for debt securities available for sale. The adoption
of CECL had a material impact to the allowance for credit losses (see below).
The cumulative effect of the modified retrospective application for all items
in scope was a reduction to retained earnings of $377 million, $375 million of
which was attributable to the allowance and $2 million of which was
attributable to other financial assets.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regions, its
subsidiaries and certain VIEs. Significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Regions considers a voting rights entity to
be a subsidiary and consolidates it if Regions has a controlling financial
interest in the entity. VIEs are consolidated if Regions has the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that significantly impact financial
performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., Regions is
the primary beneficiary). The determination of whether Regions is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Investments in
companies which are not VIEs but in which Regions has significant influence
over the operating and financing decisions, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Investments in VIEs, where Regions is not the primary
beneficiary of a VIE, are accounted for using either the proportional
amortization method or the equity method of accounting. These investments are
included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The maximum
potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally
limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and
any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in
substantially the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured.
Refer to Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding Regions' significant
VIEs.

Unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be
accounted for under the equity method and do not have a readily determinable
fair value are accounted for at cost under the measurement alternative with
adjustments for impairment and observable price changes as applicable. Cost
method investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets. Dividends received or receivable and observable price changes from
these investments are included as a component of other non-interest income in
the consolidated statements of income.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. (now Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc). The transaction closed on
July 2, 2018. Results of operations for the entities sold are presented
separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the
consolidated statements of income. Other expenses related to the transaction
are also included in discontinued operations. See Note 3 and Note 24 for
further discussion.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS

Cash equivalents represent assets that can be converted into cash immediately.
At Regions, these assets include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits in other banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired,
are classified at that time according to management's intent to either sell or
hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management's intent is to sell
the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented as operating cash flows.
When management's intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the
cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows.

The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information for the
years ended December 31:

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER
AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions.
It is Regions' policy to take possession of securities purchased under resell
agreements either through direct delivery or a tri-party agreement.

DEBT SECURITIES

Management determines the appropriate accounting classification of debt
securities at the time of purchase, based on intent, and periodically re-
evaluates such designations. Debt securities are classified as held to
maturity when the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity. Debt securities held to maturity are presented at amortized cost.
Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available
for sale. Debt securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair
value with changes in unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See the "Fair
Value Measurements" section below for discussion of determining fair value.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held to maturity and
available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the
estimated life of the security, using the interest method. Such amortization
or accretion is included in interest income on securities. Realized gains and
losses are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.

For debt securities available for sale, the Company reviews its securities
portfolio for impairment and determines if impairment is related to credit
loss or non-credit loss. In making the assessment of whether a loss is from
credit or other factors, management considers the extent to which fair value
is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a
rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among other
factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present
value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to
the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows
is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance
is created, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the
amortized cost basis.

Subsequent activity related to the credit loss component (e.g. write-offs,
recoveries) is recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses on debt
securities available for sale. Securities held to maturity are evaluated under
the allowance for credit losses model. For securities which have an
expectation of zero nonpayment of the amortized cost basis (e.g. U.S. Treasury
securities or agency securities), the expected credit loss is zero. Refer to
Note 4 for further detail and information on securities.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Regions' loans held for sale include commercial loans, investor real estate
loans and residential real estate mortgage loans. Loans held for sale are
recorded at either estimated fair value, if the fair value option is elected,
or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Regions has elected to account
for residential real estate mortgages originated with the intent to sell at
fair value. Intent is established for these conforming residential real estate
mortgage loans when Regions enters into an interest rate lock commitment.
Gains and losses on these residential mortgage loans held for sale for which
the fair value option has been elected are included in mortgage income.
Certain commercial loans held for sale where management has elected the fair
value option are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses on commercial loans
held for sale for which the fair value option has been elected are included in
capital markets income. Regions also transfers certain commercial, investor
real estate, and residential real estate mortgage portfolio loans to held for
sale when management has the intent to sell in the near term. These held for
sale loans are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. At the
time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are recorded as charge-offs when
credit related and non-interest expense when not credit related and a new cost
basis is established. Any subsequent lower of cost or market adjustment is
determined on an individual loan basis. Gains and losses on the sale of non-
performing commercial and investor real estate loans are included in other
non-interest expense. See the "Fair Value Measurements" section below for
discussion of determining estimated fair value.

LOANS

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable
future or until maturity or payoff are considered loans held for investment
(or portfolio loans). Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost
(the principal amount outstanding, net of premiums, discounts, unearned income
and deferred loan fees and costs). Regions elected to exclude accrued interest
receivable balances from the amortized cost basis. Interest receivable is
included as a separate line item on the balance sheet. Regions' loans balance
is comprised of commercial, investor real estate and consumer loans. Interest
income on all types of loans is accrued based on the contractual interest rate
and the principal amount outstanding using methods that approximate the
interest method, except for those loans classified as non-accrual. Premiums
and discounts on purchased loans and non-refundable loan origination and
commitment fees, net of direct costs of originating or acquiring loans, are
deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated lives of the related
loans as an adjustment to the loans' constant effective yield, which is
included in interest income on loans. Direct financing, sales-type and
leveraged leases are included within the commercial portfolio segment. See
Note 5 for further detail and information on loans and Note 14 for further
detail on leases.

Regions determines past due or delinquency status of a loan based on
contractual payment terms.

Commercial and investor real estate loans are placed on non-accrual if any of
the following conditions occur: 1) collection in full of contractual principal
and interest is no longer reasonably assured (even if current as to payment
status), 2) a partial charge-off has occurred, unless the loan has been
brought current under its contractual terms (original or restructured terms)
and the full originally contracted principal and interest is considered to be
fully collectible, or 3) the loan is delinquent on any principal or interest
for 90 days or more unless the obligation is secured by collateral having a
net realizable value (estimated fair value less costs to sell) sufficient to
fully discharge the obligation and the loan is in the legal process of
collection. Factors considered regarding full collection include assessment of
changes in borrower's cash flow, valuation of underlying collateral, ability
and willingness of guarantors to provide credit support, and other conditions.
Charge-offs on commercial and investor real estate loans are primarily based
on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan and occur when available
information confirms the loan is not or will not be fully collectible. Factors
considered in making these determinations are the borrower's and any
guarantor's ability and willingness to pay, the status of the account in
bankruptcy court (if applicable), and collateral value. Commercial and
investor real estate loan relationships of $250,000 or less are subject to
charge-off or charge down to estimated fair value at 180 days past due, based
on collateral value.

Non-accrual and charge-off decisions for consumer loans are dictated by the
FFIEC's Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy
which establishes standards for the classification and treatment of consumer
loans. The charge-off process drives consumer non-accrual status as follows.
If a consumer loan secured by real estate in a first lien position
(residential first mortgage or home equity) becomes 180 days past due, Regions
evaluates the loan for non-accrual status and potential charge-off based on
net loan to value exposure. For home equity loans and lines of credit in a
second lien position, the evaluation is performed at 120 days past due. If a
loan is secured by collateral having a net realizable value sufficient to
fully discharge the obligation, then a partial write-down is not necessary and
the loan remains on accrual status, provided it is in the process of legal
collection. If a partial charge-off is necessary as a result of the
evaluation, then the remaining balance is placed on non-accrual. Consumer
loans not secured by real estate are generally charged-off at either 120 days
past due for closed-end loans, 180 days past due for open-end loans other than
credit cards or the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past
due for credit cards.

When loans are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest,
amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and
amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees/costs are discontinued. When
a commercial or investor real estate loan is placed on non-accrual status,
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed and charged to
interest income. Uncollected interest accrued from prior years on commercial
and investor real estate loans placed on non-accrual status in the current
year is charged against the allowance for loan losses. When a consumer loan is
placed on non-accrual status, all

109

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income due to
immateriality. Interest collections on commercial and investor real estate
non-accrual loans are applied as principal reductions. Interest collections on
consumer loans are recorded using the cash basis, due to immateriality.

All loans on non-accrual status may be returned to accrual status and interest
accrual resumed if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the loan is
brought contractually current as to both principal and interest, 2) future
payments are reasonably expected to continue being received in accordance with
the terms of the loan and repayment ability can be reasonably demonstrated,
and 3) the loan has been performing for at least six months.

Purchased Loans

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Purchased loans are evaluated and classified as either PCD, which indicates
that the loan has experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration
since origination, or non-PCD loans. For PCD loans, the sum of the loans'
purchase price and allowance for credit losses, which is determined using the
same methodology as originated loans, becomes their initial amortized cost
basis. For non-PCD loans, the difference between the fair value and the par
value is considered the fair value mark. The non-credit discount or premium
related to PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans is accreted or
amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the
effective interest method. Subsequent changes in the allowance to the PCD and
non-PCD loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses.

TDRs

TDRs are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at
the time of restructuring, and Regions has granted a concession to the
borrower. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery
on the loan and may take the form of modifications made with the stated
interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar
risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of
normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in limited circumstances
forgiveness of principal and/or interest. Insignificant delays in payments are
not considered TDRs. TDRs can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving
to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual
facts and circumstances of the borrower. TDRs are subject to policies
governing accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of
the same product type as discussed in the "Loans" section above. Prior to the
adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, all loans with the TDR designation were
considered to be impaired, even if they were accruing. With the adoption of
CECL on January 1, 2020, the definition of impaired loans was removed from
accounting guidance.

The CAP was designed to evaluate potential consumer loan participants as early
as possible in the life cycle of the troubled loan (as described in Note 6).
Many of the modifications are finalized without the borrower ever reaching the
applicable number of days past due, and therefore the loan may never be placed
on non-accrual. Accordingly, given the positive impact of the restructuring on
the likelihood of recovery of cash flows due under the modified terms, accrual
status continues to be appropriate for these loans.

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan
modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through
the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
the CARES Act; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs. The CARES Act relief and short-term nature of
most COVID-19 deferrals precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan
modifications from being classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2020. Further,
on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law
and extended the relief from TDR classification through January 1, 2022.
Regions elected this provision.

ALLOWANCE

Regions adopted CECL using the modified retrospective method for loans held
for investment, net investment in lease assets, and off-balance sheet credit
exposures. Regions elected not to estimate an allowance on interest receivable
balances because the Company has non-accrual policies in place that provide
for the accrual of interest to cease on a timely basis when all contractual
amounts due are not expected. The cumulative effect of the retrospective
application for loans and unfunded commitments was an increase in the
allowance of $501 million and a reduction to retained earnings of $375
million, with the difference being an increase to deferred tax assets. The
adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 replaced the incurred loss methodology to
estimate the allowance with the expected loss methodology. Refer to Note 1
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019, for additional information regarding the
accounting and reporting policies related to the incurred loss methodology.

Upon the adoption of CECL, the allowance is intended to cover expected credit
losses over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost,
including unfunded commitments. Management's measurement of expected credit
losses is based on relevant information about past events, including
historical experience, current conditions, and R&S forecasts that affect the
collectability of the reported amount. For periods beyond which Regions makes
or obtains such R&S forecasts, Regions reverts to historical credit loss
information. Regions maintains an appropriate level of allowance that falls
within an acceptable range of estimated losses, measured in accordance with
GAAP. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is

110

based on many factors, including, but not limited to, an evaluation and rating
of the loan portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current economic
conditions; collateral values securing loans; levels of problem loans; volume,
growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio; regulatory guidance;
R&S economic forecasts; and other relevant factors. Changes in any of these
factors, assumptions, or the availability of new information, could require
that the allowance be adjusted in future periods, perhaps materially. Loss
forecasting models are built on historical loss information and then applied
to the current portfolio. Outputs from the loss forecasting models in
combination with Regions' qualitative framework, and other analyses are used
to inform management in its estimation of Regions' expected credit losses.
Actual losses could vary, perhaps materially, from management's estimates. The
entire allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the
loan portfolio.

Regions' allowance calculation is a significant estimate. Regions uses its
best judgment to assess economic conditions and loss data in estimating the
CECL allowance and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on
changes in underlying external or internal data. Therefore, assumptions and
decisions driving the estimate may change as conditions change. These
assumptions and estimates are detailed below.

R & S forecast period

During the two-year R&S forecast period, Regions incorporates forward-looking
information by utilizing its internally developed and approved Base economic
forecast. The scenario is developed by the Chief Economist and approved
through a formal governance process. The Base forecast considers market
forward/consensus information and is consistent with the Company's
organization-wide economic outlook. When appropriate, additional scenarios,
including externally created scenarios, are considered as part of the
determination of the allowance.

Reversion period

Regions utilizes an exponential reversion approach that reverts to TTC rates
derived from the simple average of all historical quarterly observations for
PD, LGD, EAD and prepayment rates. The length of the reversion period differs
by class of financing receivable.

Historical loss period

Regions does not adjust historical loss information for existing economic
conditions or expectations of future economic conditions for periods that are
beyond the R&S period. Regions utilizes internal historical loss information;
however, there are certain loan portfolios that also benefit from the use of
external or other reference data due to identified limitations with internal
historical data.

Contractual life

Regions estimates expected credit losses over the contractual life of a loan.
Regions defines contractual life for non-revolving loans as contractual
maturity, net of estimated prepayments and excluding expected extensions,
renewals and modifications unless 1) Regions has a reasonable expectation at
the reporting date that it will execute a TDR with the borrower ("RETDR") or
2) extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified
contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by
Regions.

RETDR

Regions individually identifies commercial and investor real estate loans for
inclusion as RETDRs. The identification criteria are based on internal risk
ratings and time to maturity. Regions typically does not identify consumer
loans as RETDRs due to the insignificant period between initial contact with a
customer regarding a loan modification and when a TDR modification is
consummated.

The RETDR status extends the life of the loan past the contractual maturity
and includes the allowance impact of interest rate concessions. Loans
identified as RETDRs will be treated consistently from a modeling/reserving
perspective as loans identified as TDRs.

Contractual term extensions (borrower versus lender option to renew)

Regions' consumer loan contracts do not permit automatic extensions or
unilateral customer extensions, and Regions retains the right to approve or
deny any extension requested from the borrower. As a result, extensions and
renewal options are not included in the life of consumer loans for the
purposes of calculating the allowance. Similarly, Regions does not include
extension and renewal options in the life of commercial loans for the purposes
of calculating the allowance, unless it is a RETDR. Most commercial products
do not offer borrowers a unilateral right to renew or extend.

Contractual life of credit card receivables

Regions estimates the life of credit card receivables based on the amount and
timing of payments expected to be collected. Regions' credit card allowance
estimate only considers the amount of debt outstanding at the reporting date
(the current position) because undrawn balances are unconditionally
cancellable and therefore are not considered. Regions classifies credit card
accounts into one of three payment patterns: dormant, transacting or
revolving. The dormant accounts are idle, carry no balance, and do not
contribute to the allowance. The transacting account holders tend to pay the
entire balance due every month

111

* * *

and are, therefore, subject to practically no interest charges. For transactor
accounts, the current position balance is expected to be paid off in one
quarter. The revolving accounts tend to be subject to interest charges, and
their current position balance liquidates over time. Regions' credit card
portfolio is comprised primarily of revolvers.

Collateral-dependent loans

Regions' collateral-dependent consumer loans are loans secured by collateral
(primarily real estate) that meet the partial charge-down requirements
disclosed within this section. Regions evaluates significant commercial and
investor real estate loans that are in financial difficulty and secured by
collateral to determine if they are collateral dependent.

For collateral-dependent loans, CECL requires an entity to measure the
expected credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral at the
reporting date when the entity determines that foreclosure is probable.
Additionally, CECL allows a fair value of collateral practical expedient as a
measurement approach for loans when the repayment is expected to be provided
substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty ("collateral dependent"). For
any collateral-dependent loans that meet Regions' specific allowance criteria
(see below), Regions will calculate the CECL allowance based on the fair value
of collateral methodology. For collateral-dependent consumer, commercial and
investor real estate loans that do not meet Regions' specific allowance
criteria (as described below), Regions considers the value of the collateral
through the LGD component of the loss model based on collateral type.

Credit enhancements

Regions' estimate of credit losses reflects how credit enhancements, other
than those that are freestanding contracts, mitigate expected credit losses on
financial assets. In the event that a credit enhancement arrangement is
considered to be a freestanding contract, Regions excludes the credit
enhancement from the related loan when estimating expected credit losses.

Unfunded commitments and other off-balance sheet items

CECL requires an entity to record a liability or allowance for credit losses
for the unfunded portion of a loan commitment in the event that the issuer
does not have the unconditional right to cancel the commitment. For an
unfunded commitment to be considered unconditionally cancellable, Regions must
be able to, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit. The
liability is measured over the full contractual period for which Regions is
exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. In
determining the liability, management considers the likelihood that funding
will occur, and if funded, the related expected credit losses under the CECL
model.

Regions' off-balance sheet unfunded commitments in the form of home equity
lines, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit and commercial
revolving products that are deemed to be conditionally cancellable will
include unfunded balances within the allowance estimate. Future advances from
certain unfunded commitments and other revolving products where Regions does
have the unconditional right to cancel these agreements will not be included.

CALCULATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Pooled allowances

The allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk
characteristics exist. Segmentation variables for commercial and investor real
estate segments include product, loan size, collateral type, risk rating and
term. Segmentation variables considered for consumer segments include product,
FICO, LTV, age, TDR status, etc. The allowance is estimated for most
portfolios and classes using econometric models to estimate expected credit
losses. In general, discounted cash flow models are not used for the purpose
of estimating expected losses for the purpose of the ACL. Most of the
econometric models include PD, LGD, and EAD components. Less complex
estimation methods are used for smaller loan portfolios.

Specific allowances

Due to their size, complexity and individualized risk characteristics and
monitoring, the allowance for significant non-accrual commercial and investor
real estate loans (including TDRs) and unfunded commitments is measured on an
individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the
collective evaluation. Regions generally measures the allowance for these
loans based on the present value of estimated cash flows, considering all
facts and circumstances specific to the borrower and market and economic
conditions. The allowance measurement for collateral-dependent loans that meet
the individually evaluated threshold is based on the fair value of collateral
methodology.

TDRs and RETDRs

Loans identified as TDRs and RETDRs are treated consistently in CECL loss
models. These loans are included in their respective loan pools (if they do
not qualify for specific evaluation) and losses are determined by CECL models.
The effect of the interest rate concession on these loans is considered
through a post-model adjustment.

Qualitative framework

While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors,
any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of
imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent
time lag

112

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

between obtaining information, performing the calculation, as well as
variations between estimates and actual outcomes. Regions adjusts the
allowance considering quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be
directly measured in the modeled calculations. Regions' qualitative framework
provides for specific, quantitatively supported model adjustments and general
imprecision adjustments. Specific model adjustments capture highly specific
issues or events that Regions believes are not adequately captured in model
outcomes. General imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision
that are not specifically identifiable or quantifiable to a particular loan
portfolio and have not been captured by the model or by a specific model
adjustment. Regions considers general imprecision in three dimensions;
economic forecast imprecision, model error imprecision, and process
imprecision.

Refer to Note 6 for further discussion regarding the calculation of the
allowance for credit losses.

LEASES

LESSEES

Regions' lease portfolio is primarily composed of property leases that are
classified as either operating or finance leases with the majority classified
as operating leases. Property leases, which primarily include office locations
and retail branches, typically have original lease terms ranging from 1 year
to 20 years, some of which may also include an option to extend the lease
beyond the original lease term. In some circumstances, Regions may also have
an option to terminate the lease early with advance notice. Regions includes
renewal and termination options within the lease term if deemed reasonably
certain of exercise. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions
utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the
lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Regions continues to recognize lease payments as an expense over the lease
term as appropriate. The remainder of the lease portfolio is comprised of
equipment leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 4 years.

Operating leases vary in term and, from time to time, include incentives
and/or rent escalations. Examples of incentives include periods of "free" rent
and leasehold improvement incentives. Regions recognizes incentives and
escalations on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of or
increase to rent expense, as applicable, within net occupancy expense in the
consolidated statements of income. See Note 14 "Leases" for additional
information.

LESSORS

Regions engages in both direct financing and sales-type leasing. Regions also
has portfolios of leveraged and operating leases. These arrangements provide
equipment financing for leased assets, such as vehicles and aircraft. At the
commencement date, Regions (lessor) enters into an agreement with the customer
(lessee) to lease the underlying equipment for a specified lease term. The
lease agreements may provide customers the option to terminate the lease by
buying the equipment at fair market value at the time of termination or at the
end of the lease term. Regions' equipment finance asset management group
performs due diligence procedures on the lease residual and overall equipment
values as part of the origination process. Regions performs lease residual
value reviews on an ongoing basis. In order to manage the residual value risk
inherent in some of its direct financing leases, Regions purchases residual
value insurance from an independent third party.

Sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases are recorded within loans
and operating leases are recorded within other earning assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The net investment in direct financing leases is
the sum of all minimum lease payments and estimated residual values, less
unearned income. Unearned income is recognized over the terms of the leases to
produce a constant effective yield. The net investment in leveraged leases is
the sum of all lease payments (less non-recourse debt payments) and estimated
residual values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged leases is
recognized over the term of the leases based on the unrecovered equity
investment. See Note 14 "Leases" for additional information.

OTHER EARNING ASSETS

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB
stock, marketable equity securities and operating lease assets. See Note 8 for
additional information.

INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK

Ownership of FRB and FHLB stock is a requirement for all banks seeking
membership into and access to the services provided by these banking systems.
These shares are accounted for at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in net income.

INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING LEASES

Investments in operating leases represent the assets underlying the related
lease contracts and are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
net of origination fees and costs. Depreciation on these assets is generally
provided on a straight-line basis over the lease term down to an estimated
residual value. Regions periodically evaluates its depreciation rate for
leased

113

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

assets based on projected residual values and adjusts depreciation expense
over the remaining life of the lease if deemed appropriate. Regions also
evaluates the current value of the operating lease assets and tests for
impairment when indicators of impairment are present. Income from operating
lease assets includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs,
and is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the
scheduled lease term. The accrual of revenue on operating leases is generally
discontinued at the time an account is determined to be uncollectible.
Operating lease revenue and the depreciation expense on the related operating
lease assets are included as components of net interest income on the
consolidated statements of income. When a leased asset is returned, its
remaining value is reclassified from other earning assets to other assets and
recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell, on
Regions' consolidated balance sheet. Impairment of the operating lease asset,
as well as residual value gains and losses at the end of the lease term are
recorded through other non-interest income.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization, as applicable. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation expense is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the
leases, if shorter). Generally, premises and leasehold improvements are
depreciated or amortized over 7-40 years. Furniture and equipment are
generally depreciated or amortized over 3-10 years. Premises and equipment are
evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense in
the consolidated statements of income. Improvements that either add
functionality or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized to the
carrying value and depreciated. See Note 9 for detail of premises and
equipment.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets include goodwill, which is the excess of cost over the fair
value of net assets of acquired businesses, and other identifiable intangible
assets. Other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the following:
1) core deposit intangible assets, which are amounts recorded related to the
value of acquired indeterminate maturity deposits, 2) amounts capitalized
related to the value of acquired customer relationships, and 3) the DUS
license. Core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationships,
customer relationship intangibles and other identifiable intangibles assets
are amortized over their expected useful lives.

The Company's goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the
fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there
may be impairment. Regions assesses the following indicators of goodwill
impairment for each reporting period:

•Recent operating performance,

•Changes in market capitalization,

•Regulatory actions and assessments,

•Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors and
competition),

•Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset
impairments, and business dispositions), and

•Trends in the banking industry.

Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other
factors could result in a decline in the implied estimated fair value of
goodwill. Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative
factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the
evidence, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair
value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the
Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is
more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a
goodwill impairment test is performed. The Company compares the estimated fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is
recognized in non-interest expense in an amount equal to that excess.

For purposes of performing the qualitative assessment, Regions evaluates
events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, events and
circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance
including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization,
regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-
specific factors, and trends in the banking industry to determine if it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
carrying amount.

For purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test, if applicable,
Regions uses both income and market approaches to value its reporting units.
The income approach, which is the primary valuation approach, consists of
discounting projected long-term future cash flows, which are derived from
internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective reporting

114

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

units. The significant inputs to the income approach include expected future
cash flows, the long-term target equity ratios, and the discount rate.

Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles,
purchased credit card relationships and other acquired customer relationships,
are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or
circumstances that could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset.
These events could include loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit
card or other types of acquired customer accounts and/or balances, increased
competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent other
identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, impairment losses are
recorded in non-interest expense and reduce the carrying amount of the asset.

Refer to Note 10 for further detail and discussion of the results of the
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles impairment tests.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

Regions accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when control over
the transferred assets is surrendered. Control is generally considered to have
been surrendered when 1) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the
Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other
receivership, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets
with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a
trivial benefit to the Company, and 3) the Company does not maintain the
obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. If these
sale criteria are met, the transferred assets are removed from the Company's
balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If not met, the
transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing, and the assets remain on the
Company's balance sheet, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a
liability, and gain or loss on sale is deferred until the sale criterion are
achieved.

Regions has elected to account for its residential MSRs using the fair value
measurement method. Under the fair value measurement method, residential MSRs
are measured at estimated fair value each period with changes in fair value
recorded as a component of mortgage income. The fair value of residential MSRs
is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market
discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors.
A significant change in prepayments of residential mortgages in the servicing
portfolio could result in significant valuation adjustments, thus creating
potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The valuation
method relies on an OAS to consider prepayment risk and equate the asset's
discounted cash flows to its market price. See the "Fair Value Measurements"
section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value.

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions' related commercial MSRs are recorded in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or estimated
fair value and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period
that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of
the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and
timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results
and updated projections. Regions periodically evaluates its commercial MSRs
for impairment. Regions has a one-third loss share guarantee associated with
the majority of the DUS servicing portfolio. The other two-thirds loss share
guarantee is retained by Fannie Mae. The estimated fair value of the loss
share guarantee is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets.

Refer to Note 7 for further information on servicing of financial assets.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY AND OTHER REAL ESTATE

Other real estate and certain other assets acquired in satisfaction of
indebtedness ("foreclosure") are carried in other assets at the lower of the
recorded investment in the loan or estimated fair value less estimated costs
to sell the property. At the date of transfer from the loan portfolio, if the
recorded investment in the loan exceeds the property's estimated fair value
less estimated costs to sell, a write-down is recorded against the allowance.
Regions allows a period of up to 60 days after the date of transfer to record
finalized write-downs as charge-offs against the allowance in order to
properly accumulate all related invoices and updated valuation information, if
necessary. Subsequent to transfer, Regions obtains valuations from
professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers on at least an
annual basis. See the "Fair Value Measurements" section below for additional
discussion regarding determination of fair value. Subsequent to transfer and
the additional 60 days, any further write-downs are recorded as other non-
interest expense. Gain or loss on the sale of foreclosed property and other
real estate is included in other non-interest expense.

From time to time, assets classified as premises and equipment are transferred
to held for sale for various reasons. These assets are carried in other assets
at the lower of the recorded investment in the asset or estimated fair value
less estimated cost to sell based upon the property's appraised value at the
date of transfer. Any adjustments to property held for sale are recorded as
other non-interest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest
rate risk, facilitate asset/liability management strategies and manage other
exposures. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps, options on
interest rate swaps,

115

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

options including interest rate caps and floors, Eurodollar futures, forward
rate contracts and forward sale commitments. All derivative financial
instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets
or other liabilities, as applicable, at estimated fair value. Regions enters
into master netting agreements with counterparties and/or requires collateral
to cover exposures. In at least some cases, counterparties post collateral at
a zero threshold regardless of credit rating. The majority of interest rate
derivatives traded by Regions with dealing counterparties are subject to
mandatory clearing through a central clearinghouse. The variation margin
payments made for derivatives cleared through a central clearinghouse are
legally characterized as settlements of the derivatives. As a result, these
positions are reflected as settled with no fair value presented for purposes
of the balance sheets and related disclosures. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse.

Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments based upon
notional amounts. Interest rate swaps subject Regions to market risk
associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility
as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Option
contracts involve rights to buy or sell financial instruments on a specified
date or over a period at a specified price. These rights do not have to be
exercised. Some option contracts such as interest rate floors, involve the
exchange of cash based on changes in specified indices. Interest rate floors
are contracts to hedge interest rate declines based on a notional amount,
generally associated with a principal balance at risk. Interest rate floors
subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates,
changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the
counterparty will fail to perform. Forward rate contracts are commitments to
buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or
yield. Regions primarily enters into forward rate contracts on marketable
instruments, which expose Regions to market risk associated with changes in
the value of the underlying financial instrument, as well as the credit risk
that the counterparty will fail to perform. Eurodollar futures are futures
contracts on Eurodollar deposits. Eurodollar futures subject Regions to market
risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are
cash settled daily through a margining process in an exchange, there is
minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Forward sale
commitments are sales of securities at a specified price at a future date.
Forward sale commitments subject Regions to market risk associated with
changes in market value, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will
fail to perform.

The Company elects to account for certain derivative financial instruments as
accounting hedges which, based on the exposure being hedged, are either fair
value or cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of the hedged risk in an asset, liability or firm commitment. Under the fair
value hedging model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value
of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses attributable to
the change in fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in interest income
or interest expense in the same income statement line item with the hedged
item in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. To the extent the
changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair
value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding
adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the
hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the
derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to other assets or other
liabilities, as applicable.

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions. For cash flow hedge
relationships, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except for
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings in
the same income statement line item where the earnings effect of the hedged
item is presented in the period or periods during which the hedged item
impacts earnings.

The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge
transactions. The Company performs periodic qualitative and quantitative
assessments to determine whether the hedging relationship has been highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items
and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in
the future.

If a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is
discontinued because the hedged item no longer exists, or does not meet the
definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded as an
other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its
estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other non-
interest expense. Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to
recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the consolidated balance
sheets and recognized in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses that
were unrecognized and aggregated in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized
immediately in other non-interest expense.

Derivative contracts for which the Company has not elected to apply hedge
accounting are classified as other assets or liabilities with gains and losses
related to the change in fair value recognized in capital markets income or
mortgage income, as applicable, in the statements of income during the period.
These positions, as well as non-derivative instruments, are used to mitigate
economic and accounting volatility related to customer derivative
transactions, the mortgage pipeline and the fair value of residential MSRs.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate.
Accordingly, such commitments are recorded at estimated fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets income,
as applicable. Regions also has corresponding forward sale commitments related
to these interest rate lock commitments, which are recorded at estimated fair
value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital
markets income, as applicable. See the "Fair Value Measurements" section below
for additional information related to the valuation of interest rate lock
commitments.

Regions enters into various derivative agreements with customers desiring
protection from possible future market fluctuations. Regions manages the
market risk associated with these derivative agreements. The contracts in this
portfolio for which the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting are
marked-to-market through capital markets income and included in other assets
and other liabilities.

Concurrent with the election to use fair value measurement for residential
MSRs, Regions began using various derivative instruments to mitigate the
impact of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs in the statements of
income. This effort may involve the use of various derivative instruments,
including, but not limited to, forwards, futures, swaps and options. These
derivatives are carried at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value
reported in mortgage income.

Refer to Note 21 for further discussion and details of derivative financial
instruments and hedging activities.

INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
expected future tax consequences. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the
differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding
tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for
any tax attributes, such as tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards.
The net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in other
assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as
appropriate. Any effect of a change in federal and state tax rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period
that includes the enactment date. The Company reflects the expected amount of
income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax
expense or benefit, as applicable.

The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering
all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent
operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future
taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards
and tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is recorded for any
deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized.

Income tax benefits generated from uncertain tax positions are accounted for
using the recognition and cumulative-probability measurement thresholds. Based
on the technical merits, if a tax benefit is not more-likely-than-not of being
sustained upon examination, the Company records a liability for the recognized
income tax benefit. If a tax benefit is more-likely-than-not of being
sustained based on the technical merits, the Company utilizes the cumulative
probability measurement and records an income tax benefit equivalent to the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company
recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits within current income tax expense.

The Company applies the proportional amortization method in accounting for its
qualified affordable housing investments. This method recognizes the amortized
cost of the investment as a component of income tax expense.

The deferral method of accounting is used for investments that generate
investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are
recognized as a reduction of the related asset.

Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding income taxes.

TREASURY STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES

The purchase of the Company's common stock is recorded at cost. At the date of
repurchase, shareholders' equity is reduced by the repurchase price. Upon
retirement, or upon purchase for constructive retirement, treasury stock would
be reduced by the cost of such stock with the excess of repurchase price over
par or stated value recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the Company
subsequently reissues treasury shares, treasury stock is reduced by the cost
of such stock with differences recorded in additional paid-in capital or
retained earnings, as applicable.

Pursuant to recent share repurchase programs, shares repurchased were
immediately retired, and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The
Company's policy related to these share repurchases is to reduce its common
stock based on the par value of the shares repurchased and to reduce its
additional paid-in capital for the excess of the repurchase price over the par
value.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Regions sponsors stock plans which most commonly include restricted stock
(i.e., unvested common stock) units, restricted stock awards, performance
stock units and stock options. The Company accounts for share-based payments
under the fair value recognition provisions whereby compensation cost is
measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date and
is recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for service-based awards. The fair
value of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or performance stock
units is determined based on the closing price of Regions common stock on the
date of grant. Historical data is also used to estimate future employee
attrition, which is considered in calculating estimated forfeitures. Estimated
forfeitures are adjusted when actual forfeitures differ from estimates,
resulting in the recognition of compensation cost only for awards that vest.
The effect of a change in estimated forfeitures is recognized through a
cumulative catch-up adjustment that is included in salaries and employee
benefits expense in the period of the change in estimate. The fair value of
stock options where vesting is based on service is estimated at the date of
grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and related assumptions. As
compensation cost is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that
represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of
restrictions. At the time the share-based awards are exercised, cancelled,
have expired, or restrictions are released, the Company may be required to
recognize an adjustment to tax expense depending on the market price of the
Company's common stock.

See Note 17 for further discussion and details of share-based payments.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Regions uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market
value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flows
during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension
plan assets. At a minimum, amortization of the net gain or loss included in
accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from experience different
from that assumed and from changes in assumptions is included as a component
of net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, that net
gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market value of plan assets. If amortization is required,
the minimum amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining
service period of active participating employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. Regions records the service cost component of net periodic
pension and postretirement benefit cost in salaries and employee benefits
expense on the consolidated statements of income. The other components of net
periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost are recorded in other non-
interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. Regions uses a
third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of active
participating employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-
retirement mortality, and other applicable employee demographics.

See Note 18 for further discussion and details of employee benefit plans.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Interest Income

The largest source of revenue for Regions is interest income. Interest income
is recognized using the interest method driven by nondiscretionary formulas
based on written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund fees and other
service charges. Non-sufficient fund fees are earned when a depositor presents
an item for payment in excess of available funds, and Regions, at its
discretion, provides the necessary funds to complete the transaction.

Regions generates other service charges by providing depositors proper
safeguard and remittance of funds as well as by providing optional services
for depositors, such as check imaging or treasury management, that are
performed upon the depositor's request. Charges for the proper safeguard and
remittance of funds are recognized monthly, as the customer retains funds in
the account. Regions recognizes revenue for other optional services when the
customer uses the selected service to execute a transaction (e.g., execute an
ACH wire).

Card and ATM Fees

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card, debit card, and
ATM related revenue. The majority of the fees are card interchange where
Regions earns a fee for remitting cardholder funds (or extends credit) via a
third party network to merchants. Regions satisfies performance obligations
for each transaction when the card is used and the funds are remitted. The
network establishes interchange fees that the merchant remits to Regions for
each transaction, and Regions incurs costs from the network for facilitating
the interchange with the merchant. Due to its inability to establish prices
and direct activities of the related processing network's service, Regions is
deemed the agent in this arrangement and records interchange revenues net of
related costs. Regions also pays consideration to certain commercial card
holders based on interchange fees and contractual volume. These costs are
recognized as a reduction to interchange income.

118

Table of Contents

  

  

  

Card and ATM fees also include ATM fee income generated from allowing a
Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a non-Regions ATM and from allowing
a non-Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a Regions ATM. Regions
satisfies performance obligations for each transaction when the withdrawal is
processed. Regions does not direct activities of the related processing
network's service and recognizes revenue on a net basis as the agent in each
transaction.

Investment Management and Trust Fee Income

Investment management and trust fee income represents revenue generated from
asset management services provided to individuals, businesses, and
institutions. Regions has a fiduciary responsibility to the beneficiary of the
trust to perform agreed upon services which can include investing the assets,
periodic reporting to the beneficiaries, and providing tax information
regarding the trust. In exchange for these trust and custodial services,
Regions collects fee income from beneficiaries as contractually determined via
fee schedules. Regions' performance obligations to customers are primarily
satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the
customer.

Mortgage Income

Mortgage income is recognized when earned or as each transaction occurs
through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-
term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary
market. Mortgage income also includes any fair value adjustments for mortgage
loans Regions has elected to measure under the fair value option and fair
value adjustments related to mortgage servicing rights.

Capital Markets Income

Regions generates capital markets fee revenue through capital raising
activities which include revenue streams such as securities underwriting and
placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange,
derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. For those
revenue streams, revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time which
coincides with the satisfaction of a single performance obligation, typically
the transaction closing.

Securities underwriting and placement fees involve the issuing and
distribution of securities for an underwriting fee from customers. The
underwriting fee is a single performance obligation which is satisfied at the
time that the transaction is closed, and the amount of the fee is either a
fixed or variable percentage based on the deal value which is determinable at
the time of deal closing.

Regions generates revenue from affordable housing investments through the
syndication of investment funds to third parties. Regions transfers the
primary benefits of the investment to the customer and recognizes syndication
revenue on the closing date of the transaction.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance

Bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the
appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the
proceeds of insurance benefits. Regions recognizes revenue each period in the
amount of the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the insurance
policies. Revenue from the proceeds of insurance benefits is recognized at the
time a claim is confirmed.

Commercial Credit Fee Income

Commercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and unused
commercial commitment fees. Regions recognizes revenue for letters of credit
fees over time. Regions recognizes revenue for unused commercial commitment
fees on the date that the commitment expires.

Investment Services Fee Income

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment
advisory services. Through the use of third party carriers, Regions provides
its customers with access to investment products that meet customers'
financial needs and investment objectives. Upon selection of an investment
product, the customer enters into a policy with the carrier. Regions'
performance obligation is satisfied by fulfilling its responsibility to place
customers in investment vehicles for which Regions earns commissions from the
carrier based on agreed-upon fee percentages. In addition, Regions has a
contractual relationship with a third party broker dealer to provide full
service brokerage and investment advisory activities. As the principal in the
arrangement, Regions recognizes the investment services commissions on a gross
basis.

Securities Gains (Losses), Net

Net securities gains or losses result from Regions' asset/liability management
process. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized as each
sales transaction occurs with the cost of securities sold based on the
specific identification method.

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets

Regions holds assets for certain employee benefit assets, both defined and
other. Those assets are recorded at estimated fair value and the market value
variations are recognized each period.

119

Table of Contents

  

  

  

Other Miscellaneous Income

Other miscellaneous income includes miscellaneous revenue from affordable
housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit
boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income including unusual gains.
Regions recognizes the related fee or gain in a manner that reflects the
timing of when transactions occur or as services are provided.

PER SHARE AMOUNTS

Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated
by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the effect
of outstanding stock options, restricted and performance stock awards if
dilutive. Refer to Note 16 for additional information.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value guidance establishes a framework for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities and defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as
opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to
assume the liability (an entry price). A fair value measure should reflect the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular
valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an
asset and the risk of nonperformance. Required disclosures include
stratification of balance sheet amounts measured at fair value based on inputs
the Company uses to derive fair value measurements. These strata include:

•Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for
identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include
exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume),

•Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for
similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation
techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market,
and

•Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based
techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but
observable based on Company-specific data. These unobservable assumptions
reflect the Company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically
include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or
liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or
liability.

ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

Debt securities available for sale, certain mortgage loans held for sale,
marketable equity securities, residential MSRs, derivative assets and
derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Below
is a description of valuation methodologies for these assets and liabilities.

Debt securities available for sale consist of U.S. Treasuries, obligations of
states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities (including
agency securities), and other debt securities.

•U.S. Treasuries are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets
on active exchanges. Pricing received for U.S. Treasuries from third-party
services is based on a market approach using dealer quotes from multiple
active market makers and real-time trading systems. These valuations are Level
1 measurements.

•Mortgage-backed securities are valued primarily using data from third-party
pricing services for similar securities as applicable. Pricing from these
third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable
inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes,
benchmark securities, TBA prices, issuer spreads, bids and offers, monthly
payment information, and collateral performance, as applicable. These
valuations are Level 2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not
available, the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not
readily observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3
measurements.

•Obligations of states and political subdivisions are generally based on data
from third-party pricing services. The valuations are based on a market
approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, MSRB reported
trades, material event notices and new issue data. These valuations are Level
2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not available, the Company
develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily observable in
the market place; these valuations are Level 3 measurements.

•Other debt securities are valued based on Level 1, 2 and 3 measurements,
depending on pricing methodology selected and are valued primarily using data
from third-party pricing services. Pricing from these third-party services is
generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark
securities, bids and offers, and TRACE reported trades.

The majority of Regions' debt securities available for sale are valued using
third-party pricing services. To validate pricing related to liquid investment
securities, which represent the vast majority of the available for sale
portfolio (e.g., mortgage-

120

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

backed securities), Regions compares price changes received from the third-
party pricing service to overall changes in market factors in order to
validate the pricing received. To validate pricing received on less liquid
investment securities in the available for sale portfolio, Regions receives
pricing from third-party brokers-dealers on a sample of securities that are
then compared to the pricing received. The pricing service uses standard
observable inputs when available, for example: benchmark yields, reported
trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, and bids
and offers, among others. For certain security types, additional inputs may be
used, or some inputs may not be applicable. It is not customary for Regions to
adjust the pricing received for the available for sale portfolio. In the event
that prices are adjusted, Regions classifies the measurement as a Level 3
measurement.

Mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential first mortgage loans and
commercial mortgages held for sale. Regions has elected to measure certain
residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value by
applying the fair value option (see additional discussion under the "Fair
Value Option" section in Note 22). The residential first mortgage loans held
for sale are valued based on traded market prices of similar assets where
available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing value and market conditions,
a Level 2 measurement. The commercial mortgage loans held for sale are valued
based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed
securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements
of interest rates and credit spreads, a Level 3 measurement due to the
unobservable inputs included in the credit spreads for bonds in commercial
mortgage-backed securitizations.

Marketable equity securities, which primarily consist of assets held for
certain employee benefits and money market funds, are valued based on quoted
market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are
Level 1 measurements.

Residential mortgage servicing rights are valued using an option-adjusted
spread valuation approach, a Level 3 measurement. The underlying assumptions
and estimated values are corroborated at least quarterly by values received
from independent third parties. See Note 7 for information regarding the
servicing of financial assets and additional details regarding the assumptions
relevant to this valuation.

Derivative assets and liabilities, which primarily consist of interest rate,
foreign exchange, and commodity contracts that include forwards, futures,
options and swaps, are included in other assets and other liabilities (as
applicable) on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest rate swaps are
predominantly traded in over-the-counter markets and, as such, values are
determined using widely accepted discounted cash flow models, which are Level
2 measurements. These discounted cash flow models use projections of future
cash payments/receipts that are discounted at an appropriate index rate.
Regions utilizes OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation
of interest rate and commodity derivatives. The projected future cash flows
are sourced from an assumed yield curve, which is consistent with industry
standards and conventions. These valuations are adjusted for the unsecured
credit risk at the reporting date, which considers collateral posted and the
impact of master netting agreements. For options and futures contracts traded
in over-the-counter markets, values are determined using discounted cash flow
analyses and option pricing models based on market rates and volatilities,
which are Level 2 measurements. Interest rate lock commitments on loans
intended for sale and risk participations categorized as credit derivatives
are valued using option pricing models that incorporate significant
unobservable inputs, and therefore are Level 3 measurements.

Equity investments, which consists of the Company's holding in an equity
investee that is traded on an active exchange, is valued using a quoted market
price for a similar instrument in an active market, adjusted for marketability
considerations; this valuation is a Level 2 measurement.

ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS

From time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a non-
recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically are a
result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a
write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an
asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered to be
at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. In periods where
there is no adjustment, the asset is generally not considered to be at fair
value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Foreclosed property and other real estate is carried in other assets at the
lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less estimated
costs to sell the property. The fair value for foreclosed property that is
based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally
committed sale prices is classified as a Level 2 measurement. If no formally
committed sale price is available, Regions also obtains valuations from
professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers. Updated
valuations are obtained on at least an annual basis. Foreclosed property
exceeding established dollar thresholds is valued based on appraisals.
Appraisals are performed by third-parties with appropriate professional
certifications and conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as
evidenced by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.
Regions' policies related to appraisals conform to regulations established by
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and
other regulatory guidance. Professional valuations are considered Level 2
measurements because they are based largely on observable inputs. Regions has
a centralized appraisal review function that is

121

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

responsible for reviewing appraisals for compliance with banking regulations
and guidelines as well as appraisal standards. Based on these reviews, Regions
may make adjustments to the market value conclusions determined in the
appraisals of real estate (either as other real estate or loans held for sale)
when the appraisal review function determines that the valuation is based on
inappropriate assumptions or where the conclusion is not sufficiently
supported by the market data presented in the appraisal. Adjustments to the
market value conclusions are discussed with the professional valuation experts
and/or third-party appraisers; the magnitude of the adjustments that are not
mutually agreed upon is insignificant. Adjustments, if made, must be based on
sufficient information available to support an alternate opinion of market
value. An estimated standard discount factor, which is updated at least
annually, is applied to the appraisal amount for certain commercial and
investor real estate properties when the recorded investment in the loan is
transferred into foreclosed property. Internally adjusted valuations are
considered Level 3 measurements as management uses assumptions that may not be
observable in the market. These non-recurring fair value measurements are
typically recorded on the date an updated offered quote, appraisal, or third-
party valuation is received.

Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are adjusted
prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price transaction for
a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs; these valuations are
Level 3 measurements.

Loans held for sale for which the fair value option has not been elected are
recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at
fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair values for commercial loans held
for sale are based on Company-specific data not observable in the market.
These valuations are Level 3 measurements.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
fair values of financial instruments that are not disclosed above:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets and statements of cash flows approximate the estimated fair
values. Because these amounts generally relate to either currency or highly
liquid assets, these are considered Level 1 valuations.

Debt securities held to maturity: The fair values of debt securities held to
maturity are estimated in the same manner as the corresponding debt securities
available for sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Loans (excluding sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases), net of
unearned income and allowance for loan losses: A discounted cash flow method
under the income approach is utilized to estimate the fair value of the loan
portfolio. The discounted cash flow method relies upon assumptions about the
amount and timing of scheduled principal and interest payments, principal
prepayments, and current market rates. The loan portfolio is aggregated into
categories based on loan type and credit quality. For each loan category,
weighted average statistics, such as coupon rate, age, and remaining term are
calculated. These are Level 3 valuations.

Other earning assets (excluding equity investments and operating leases): The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the
estimated fair values. While these instruments are not actively traded in the
market, the majority of the inputs required to value them are actively quoted
and can be validated through external sources. Accordingly, these are Level 2
valuations.

Deposits: The fair value of non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-
bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and
certain other time deposit accounts is the amount payable on demand at the
reporting date (i.e., the carrying amount). Fair values for certificates of
deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market
spreads to benchmark rates. These are Level 2 valuations.

Short-term and long-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of short-term
borrowings reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the
estimated fair values, and are considered Level 2 measurements as similar
instruments are traded in active markets. The fair values of certain long-term
borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments
in active markets and are considered Level 1 measurements. The fair values of
certain long term borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of
identical instruments in non-active markets and are considered Level 2
valuations. Otherwise, valuations are based on non-binding broker quotes and
are considered Level 3 valuations.

Loan commitments and letters of credit: The fair value of these instruments is
reasonably estimated by the carrying value of deferred fees plus the unfunded
loan commitments reserve related to the creditworthiness of our counterparty.
Because the valuation inputs are not observable in the market and are
considered Company specific, these are Level 3 valuations.

See Note 22 for additional information related to fair value measurements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The following table provides a brief description of accounting standards
adopted in 2020 and those that could have a material impact to Regions'
consolidated financial statements upon adoption in the future.

statements or other significant matters

ASU 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief to Topic 326  
  
ASU 2019-11, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses  
  
ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  
| This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses to replace
the current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss
approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other
commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all
available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and R&S forecasts.
The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect the portion of the
amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to collect.  
  
The ASU also eliminates the current accounting model for purchased credit-
impaired loans, but requires an allowance to be recognized for purchased-
credit-deteriorated (PCD) assets (those that have experienced more-than-
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination). Entities
that had loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should
prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit
deteriorated assets.  
  
Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required upon
adoption.  
  
While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the
ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit
losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized
cost of the securities by direct write-offs.  
  
The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. | January 1, 2020
|

The allowance increased by $501 million based on loan exposure balances and
Regions' internally developed macroeconomic forecast upon adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2020.

  

The increase in the allowance at adoption was primarily the result of
significant increases within the consumer portfolio segment, specifically
residential first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines, and
indirect-other consumer. The impact to the residential first mortgage and home
equity classes was mainly driven by their longer time to maturity.
Additionally, a significant portion of the indirect-other consumer class is
unsecured lending through third parties which yielded higher loss rates. Under
CECL these higher loss rates compounded over a life of loan estimate result in
a significantly larger allowance estimate.

  

A suite of controls including governance, data, forecast and model controls
was in place at adoption.

  

The impact was reflected as a reduction of approximately $375 million to
retained earnings and an increase of approximately $126 million to deferred
tax assets. In the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Banking agencies
finalized a rule related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, plus 25 percent of subsequent changes in allowance. At December 31,
2020 this amount is approximately $582 million year-to-date. The impact on
CET1 is approximately 54 basis points.

There was no material impact to available for sale or held to maturity
securities upon adoption of CECL, nor to any other financial assets in scope.
Most of the held to maturity portfolio consists of agency-backed securities
that inherently have an immaterial risk of loss. Additionally, Regions had no
purchase credit impaired assets that were converted to PCD upon adoption.

  

See relevant sections of this note for additional information about Regions'
CECL methodologies and assumptions.

| The amendments in this Update require that an entity measure and classify
share-based payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance in
Topic 718. The amount recorded as a reduction of the transaction price is
required to be measured on the basis of the grant-date fair value of the
share-based payment award measured in accordance with Topic 718. The grant
date is the date at which a grantor (supplier) and grantee (customer) reach a
mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment
award. The classification and subsequent measurement of the award are subject
to the guidance in Topic 718 unless the share-based payment award is
subsequently modified and the grantee is no longer a customer.

This Update was issued to make minor technical corrections and improvements to
the Codification as part of an ongoing FASB project to clarify guidance and
correct inconsistent application of unclear guidance. This ASU provides
clarification for disclosures related to the fair value option and debt

NOTE 2. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Regions is involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs, as
defined by authoritative accounting literature. Generally, a VIE is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other legal structure that either does not
have equity investors with substantive voting rights or has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support
its activities. The following discusses the VIEs in which Regions has a
significant interest.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt
and equity. These partnerships meet the definition of a VIE. Regions uses the
proportional amortization method to account for these investments. Due to the
nature of the management activities of the general partner, Regions is not the
primary beneficiary of these partnerships. See Note 1 for additional details.
Additionally, Regions has loans or letters of credit commitments with certain
limited partnerships. The funded portion of the loans and letters of credit
are classified as commercial and industrial loans or investor real estate
loans as applicable in Note 5.

A summary of Regions' affordable housing tax credit investments and related
loans and letters of credit, representing Regions' maximum exposure to loss as
of December 31 is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2020| | 2019  
| (In millions)  
Affordable housing tax credit investments included in other assets| $| 975 | |
| $| 932 |  
Unfunded affordable housing tax credit commitments included in other
liabilities| 249 | | | $| 213 |  
Loans and letters of credit commitments| 243 | | | $| 265 |  
Funded portion of loans and letters of credit commitments| 130 | | | $| 157 |

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized| $| 164 | | | $| 165 | | | $|
174 |  
Tax credit amortization expense included in provision for income taxes| 133 |
| | 131 | | | 137 |  
  
In addition to the investments discussed above, Regions also syndicates
affordable housing investments. In these syndication transactions, Regions
creates affordable housing funds in which a subsidiary is the general partner
or managing member and sells limited partnership interests to third parties.
Regions' general partner or managing member interest represents an
insignificant interest in the affordable housing fund. The affordable housing
funds meet the definition of a VIE. As Regions is not the primary beneficiary
and does not have a significant interest, these investments are not
consolidated. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the value of Regions' general
partnership interest in affordable housing investments was immaterial.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

Other investments determined to be VIEs include investments in CRA projects,
SBICs, and other miscellaneous investments. A summary of Regions' equity
method investments representing Regions' maximum exposure to loss as of
December 31 is as follows:

(1)The gross unrealized losses recognized in OCI on securities held to
maturity resulted from a transfer of securities available for sale to held to
maturity in the second quarter of 2013.

Debt securities with carrying values of $10.3 billion and $8.3 billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds,
trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements. Included within total
pledged securities is approximately $24 million of encumbered U.S. Treasury

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above decreased from 500 at December 31, 2019 to 129 at December 31,
2020. The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of gross
unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in market interest rates. In
instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication of an
adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables above. As
it relates to these positions, management believes no individual unrealized
loss, other than those discussed below, represented credit impairment as of
those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely
than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the
recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale are shown in the table below. The cost of securities sold
is based on the specific identification method. As part of the Company's
normal process for evaluating impairment, management did identify a limited
number of positions where impairment was believed to exist in certain periods,
as shown in the table below.

_________

(1)Loans are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and
premiums and net deferred loan costs of $678 million and $234 million at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

During both 2020 and 2019, Regions purchased approximately $1.6 billion in
indirect-other consumer, residential first mortgage and commercial and
industrial loans from third parties. The 2020 purchases do not include loans
from the Ascentium acquisition.

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending
business due to margin compression impacting overall returns on the portfolio.
Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of
2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings at the end of
the second quarter of 2019. The Company remains in the direct auto lending
business.

At December 31, 2020, $20.8 billion in securities and net eligible loans held
by Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the
FHLB. At December 31, 2020, an additional $17.6 billion in net eligible loans
held by Regions were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

See Note 14 for details regarding Regions' investment in sales-type, direct
financing, and leveraged leases included within the commercial and industrial
loan portfolio.

NOTE 6. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. The methodology is described in Note 1.

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaces the incurred loss
methodology with an expected loss methodology. Refer to Note 1 for a
description of the adoption of CECL and Regions' allowance methodology.
Additionally, refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to
the consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2019, for a description of the methodology prior
to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

As of December 31, 2020, Regions' total loans included $3.6 billion of PPP
loans. These loans are guaranteed by the Federal government and as the
guarantee is not separable from the loans, Regions recorded an immaterial
allowance on these loans.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The cumulative effect of the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 for loans and
unfunded commitments was an increase in the allowance of $501 million. During
2020, Regions increased the allowance by an additional $878 million to $2.3
billion, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over
the life of the portfolio. The increase was due primarily to

131

higher expected credit losses due to the economic impact and ongoing
uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the purchase of Ascentium.
Macroeconomic factors utilized in the CECL loss models include, but are not
limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, HPI and the S&P 500 index, with
unemployment being the most significant macroeconomic factor within the CECL
models. Regions' models are sensitive to changes in the economic scenario,
specifically to the level of unemployment. The December 31, 2020 economic
forecast includes a high degree of uncertainty around how long the COVID-19
pandemic will persist, the timeliness and effectiveness of vaccinations and
the effectiveness of government relief programs and debt payment relief
provided by Regions. These factors cannot be fully reflected in the models.
Therefore, the risks to the economic forecast and the model limitations were
considered through model adjustments and the qualitative framework.

The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by
portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The
total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances
for the years ended 2019 and 2018 are disaggregated to detail the amounts
derived through individual evaluation and collective evaluation for
impairment. Prior to 2020, the allowance for loan losses related to
individually evaluated loans was attributable to allowances for non-accrual
commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs ("impaired loans") and
the allowance for loan losses related to collectively evaluated loans was
attributable to the remainder of the portfolio. With the adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2020, the impaired loan designation and disclosures related to
impaired loans are no longer required.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the
portfolio segments.

Commercial--The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and
industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations
to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion
projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by

133

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

the creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from
customers' business operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in
commodity prices.

Investor Real Estate--Loans for real estate development are repaid through
cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This
portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or
investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income
generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real
estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product
types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions' markets.
Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such
as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping
centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the
valuation of real estate.

Consumer--The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage,
home equity lines, home equity loans, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other
consumer, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans. Residential first
mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These
loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are
extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Home equity lending
includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending,
which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence,
allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate
market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the
amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact the
depth of potential losses. Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending
initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans
made through automotive dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending includes
other point of sale lending through third parties. Consumer credit card
lending includes Regions branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer
loans include other revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and
overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and
other key consumer economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The following tables present credit quality indicators for the loan portfolio
segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of December 31, 2020.

Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are detailed by
categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default.
Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the
relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis
or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the
borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories
are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.

•Pass--includes obligations where the probability of default is considered
low;

•Special Mention--includes obligations that have potential weakness that may,
if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the
Company's position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also
be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an
adverse effect on debt service ability;

•Substandard Accrual--includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined
weakness that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are
currently performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct
possibility that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these
weaknesses are not corrected;

•Non-accrual--includes obligations where management has determined that full
payment of principal and interest is in doubt.

Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to
as "classified." Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans
are often collectively referred to as "criticized and classified."

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment rates, home prices, accrual status and geography as credit
quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio. FICO scores are obtained
at origination as part of Regions' formal underwriting process. Refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans, including
residential first mortgage loans. Current FICO data is not available for
certain loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers
do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. These
categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.
The higher the FICO score the less probability of default and vice versa.

With the adoption of CECL in 2020, the disclosure of credit quality indicators
for loan portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, is
presented by credit quality indicator by vintage year. Regions defines the
vintage date for the purposes of disclosure as the date of the most recent
credit decision. In general, renewals are categorized as new credit decisions
and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Loans that are modified as a
TDR are considered to be a continuation of the original loan, therefore the
origination date of the original loan is reflected as the vintage date. The
following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of December
31, 2020. Classes in the commercial and investor real estate portfolio
segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes in the consumer portfolio
segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for
Credit Losses" in the

AGING AND NON-ACCRUAL ANALYSIS

The following tables include an aging analysis of DPD and loans on non-accrual
status for each portfolio segment and class as of December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019. Loans on non-accrual status with no related allowance
included $112 million of commercial and industrial loans as of December 31,
2020. Non-accrual loans with no related allowance typically include loans
where the underlying collateral is deemed sufficient to recover all remaining
principal. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, all TDRs and all
non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans, excluding leases, were
deemed to be impaired. The definition of impairment and the required impaired
loan disclosures were removed with CECL. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit
Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019
for disclosure of Regions' impaired loans as of December 31, 2019. Loans that
have been fully charged-off do not appear in the tables below.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Typical modifications include
accommodations, such as renewals and forbearances. The majority of Regions'
commercial and investor real estate TDRs are the result of renewals of
classified loans at an interest rate that is not considered to be a market
interest rate. For smaller dollar commercial loans, Regions may periodically
grant interest rate and other term concessions, similar to those under the
consumer program described below.

Regions works to meet the individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem
foreclosure through its CAP. Regions designed the program to allow for
customer-tailored modifications with the goal of keeping customers in their
homes and avoiding foreclosure where possible. Modification may be offered to
any borrower experiencing financial hardship regardless of the borrower's
payment status. Consumer TDRs primarily involve an interest rate concession,
however under the CAP, Regions may also offer a short-term deferral, a term
extension, a new loan product, or a combination of these options. For loans
restructured under the CAP, Regions expects to collect the original
contractually due principal. The gross original contractual interest may be
collectible, depending on the terms modified. All CAP modifications are
considered TDRs regardless of the term because they are concessionary in
nature and because the customer documents a financial hardship in order to
participate.

As noted above, the majority of Regions' TDRs are results of interest rate
concessions and not a forgiveness of principal. Accordingly, the financial
impact of the modifications is best illustrated by the impact to the allowance
calculation at the loan or pool level, as a result of the loans being
considered impaired due to their TDR status. Regions most often does not
record a charge-off at the modification date.

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan
modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through
the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 were
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
the CARES Act; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.
The CARES Act relief and short-term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals
precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan modifications from being
classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2020. Further, on December 27, 2020, the
Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law and extended the relief
from TDR classification through the earlier of 60 days after the national
emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends or January 1, 2022. Regions
elected this provision.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs.

NOTE 7. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method for the years ended December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| (68)| | | (53)| | | (47)|  
Carrying value, end of year| $| 296 | | | $| 345 | | | $| 418 |  
  
_________

(1)"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. In the first quarter of 2020,
Regions revised its MSR decay methodology from a passage of time approach to a
discounted net cash flow approach. The change in methodology results in shifts
between decay and hedge impacts, but does not impact the overall valuation.

In 2020, the Company purchased the rights to service residential mortgage
loans on a flow basis for approximately $59 million.

In 2019, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $409
million in residential mortgage loans for approximately $4 million.
Additionally, Regions purchased the rights to service residential mortgage
loans on a flow basis for approximately $13 million. The Company also sold
$167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans and as part of
the transaction kept the rights to service the loans, which resulted in the
retained residential MSR of approximately $2 million.

In 2018, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $6.1
billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $77 million.
Approximately $7 million of the purchase price was paid in 2019.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) as of December 31 are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2020| | 2019  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 34,454 | | | $| 34,467 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 15.6 | %| | 12.0 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (23)| | | $| (19)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (42)| | | $| (35)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 560 | | | 618 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (7)| | | $| (8)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (13)| | | $| (16)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.9 | %| | 4.2 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 287| | 278  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.5 | | | 27.3 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income
resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans for the years ended
December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 for additional information. Also see
Note 24 for additional information related to the guarantee.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the DUS servicing portfolio was
approximately $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The related
commercial MSRs were approximately $74 million and $59 million at December 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs
was approximately $81 million and $64 million at December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively.

NOTE 8. OTHER EARNING ASSETS

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB
stock, marketable equity securities and operating lease assets. See Note 14

NOTE 10. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL

Goodwill allocated to each reportable segment (each a reporting unit) at
December 31 is presented as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2020| | 2019

Wealth Management| 393 | | | 393 |  
| $| 5,190 | | | $| 4,845 |  
  
The goodwill allocated to the Corporate Bank reporting unit increased due to
the acquisition of Ascentium in the second quarter of 2020.

Regions assessed the indicators of goodwill impairment for all three reporting
units as part of its annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2020, and
through the date of the filing of this Annual Report, by performing a
qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In performing
the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances
since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including
reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory
actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific
factors and trends in the banking industry. The results of the qualitative
assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair
value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the test date;
therefore, the quantitative goodwill impairment tests were deemed unnecessary.

services.

Core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationships and other
customer relationship intangibles are being amortized in other non-interest
expense on an accelerated basis over their expected useful lives. Other
remaining intangibles are amortized in other non-interest expense on a
straight line basis over their expected useful lives.

Regions purchased a DUS license in 2014. The intangible asset associated with
the DUS license is a non-amortizing intangible asset. Refer to Note 7 for
additional information related to this license.

The aggregate amount of amortization expense for core deposit intangibles,
purchased credit card relationship assets, and other intangible assets is
estimated as follows:

As of December 31, 2020, Regions had three issuances and Regions Bank had one
issuance of subordinated notes totaling $553 million and $496 million,
respectively, with stated interest rates ranging from 6.45% to 7.75%. All
issuances of these notes are, by definition, subordinated and subject in right
of payment of both principal and interest to the prior payment in full of all
senior indebtedness of the Company, which is generally defined as all
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its creditors, except
subordinated indebtedness. Payment of the principal of the notes may be
accelerated only in the case of certain events involving bankruptcy,
insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the Company. The subordinated
notes described above qualify as Tier 2 capital under Federal Reserve
guidelines, subject to diminishing credit as the respective maturity dates
approach and subject to certain transition provisions. None of the
subordinated notes are redeemable prior to maturity, unless there is an
occurrence of a qualifying capital event.

In the second quarter of 2020, Regions issued $750 million of 2.25% senior
notes due 2025. Also in the second quarter, Regions executed a partial tender
of the two senior bank notes due April 2021. In the third quarter, Regions
redeemed the two senior bank notes due August 2021 in their entirety. In the
fourth quarter, Regions redeemed the 2.75% senior notes due August 2022 in
their entirety. In conjunction with the partial tenders, redemptions, and
early terminations of FHLB advances Regions incurred related early
extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $22 million.

As a part of Regions' acquisition of Ascentium on April 1, 2020, the Company
assumed note securitizations with a remaining balance of $97 million as of
December 31, 2020. The Ascentium note securitizations have two classes and
have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.12% as of December 31, 2020, with
remaining maturities ranging from 3 years to 5 years and a weighted-average of
4.1 years.

On January 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the
redemption on January 22, 2021, of its 3.20% senior notes due February 2021
pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of
100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On February 19, 2021, Regions Bank sent notices of redemption, which will
result in the redemption on March 1, 2021 of its 2.75% senior bank notes due
April 1, 2021 and of its senior floating rate bank notes due April 1, 2021
pursuant to their

145

terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

FHLB advances at December 31, 2019 and 2018 had a weighted-average interest
rate of 1.9 percent, and 2.6 percent, respectively. FHLB borrowing capacity is
contingent upon the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions has
pledged certain loans as collateral for the FHLB advances outstanding. See
Note 5 for loans pledged to the FHLB at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Additionally, membership in the FHLB requires an institution to hold FHLB
stock. See Note 8 for the amount of FHLB stock held at December 31, 2020 and
2019. Regions' total borrowing capacity with the FHLB (including outstanding
advances) as of December 31, 2020, based on assets available for collateral at
that date, was approximately $16.2 billion.

Regions uses derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage
interest rate risk by converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a
variable-rate. The effective rate adjustments related to these hedges are
included in interest expense on long-term borrowings. The weighted-average
interest rate on total long-term debt, including the effect of derivative
instruments, was 2.7 percent, 3.4 percent, and 3.2 percent for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Further discussion of
derivative instruments is included in Note 21.

The aggregate amount of contractual maturities of all long-term debt in each
of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

Thereafter| 298 | | | 498 |  
| $| 2,718 | | | $| 851 |  
  
On February 22, 2019, Regions filed a shelf registration statement with the
SEC. This shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. The
registration statement will expire in February 2022.

Regions Bank may issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank
note program or as stand-alone issuances. Notes issued by Regions Bank may be
senior or subordinated notes. Notes issued by Regions Bank are not deposits
and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions. Regulatory approval would be required
for retirement of some securities.

NOTE 13. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Banking regulations identify five capital categories: well-capitalized,
adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and
critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Regions and
Regions Bank exceeded all current regulatory requirements, and were classified
as "well-capitalized." Management believes that no events or changes have
occurred subsequent to December 31, 2020 that would change this designation.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require institutions to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier
1, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets
(as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (the "Leverage"
ratio).

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL in regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an add-back to the regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a
two-year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in
over the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of
initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the
allowance. At December 31, 2020, the impact of the addback on CET1 was
approximately $582 million, or approximately 54 basis points.

The following tables summarize the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory capital requirements:

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized Regions' SCB
requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021
at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the amount of capital
degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, inclusive of four
quarters of planned common stock dividends. The Federal Reserve may decide at
any point through March 31, 2021 to update Regions' and other firms' SCB
requirement based on the results of its supervisory stress test associated
with the capital plan resubmission disclosed in December 2020.

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential
standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters
related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under
these rules.

Substantially all net assets are owned by subsidiaries. The primary source of
operating cash available to Regions is provided by dividends from
subsidiaries. Statutory limits are placed on the amount of dividends the
subsidiary bank can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition,
regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum capital-to-asset
ratios at banking subsidiaries. Under the Federal Reserve's Regulation H,
Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay
a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar
year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank's net income for that year and (b)
its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any
required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the
retirement of preferred stock. Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a
dividend to Regions in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until the
bank's surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. Regions Bank is
also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama
Superintendent of Banking prior to paying a dividend to Regions if the total
of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the
total of (a) Regions Bank's net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained
net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus. The statute defines net earnings as "the remainder of all earnings
from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and
other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating
expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all
federal, state and local taxes." In addition to dividend restrictions, Federal
statutes also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the parent
company.

In addition, Regions must adhere to various HUD regulatory guidelines
including required minimum capital to maintain their HUD approved status.
Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this
certification. As of December 31, 2020, Regions was in compliance with HUD
guidelines. Regions is also subject to various capital requirements by
secondary market investors.

NOTE 14. LEASES

LESSEE

As of December 31, 2020, assets and liabilities recorded under operating
leases for properties were $475 million and $545 million, respectively, and
$443 million and $514 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The
difference between the asset and liability balance is largely driven by
increases in rent over the lease term and any strategic decisions to exit a
lease location early, resulting in derecognition of the asset. The asset is
recorded within other assets, and the lease liability is recorded within other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense, which is
operating lease costs recorded within net occupancy expense in the
consolidated statements of income, was $85 and $81 million for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Other information related to operating leases at December 31 is as follows:

Series B, Series C, and Series D preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared a total of $64 million in cash dividends on
both Series A and Series B Preferred Stock during both 2020 and 2019. In 2020

redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $113 million, $67 million, $10 million,
or $4 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $100 million of Series A preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and
approximately $13 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Approximately $52
million of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of
preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to
retained earnings, and approximately $15 million of related issuance costs
that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related
surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common
shareholders. Approximately $10 million of Series C issuance costs that were
recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be
recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders.
Approximately $4 million of Series D issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020 and Regions is in compliance with the capital plan. Prior to the
supervisory stress test submission, the Board had authorized for the
repurchase of $1.370 billion of the Company's common stock repurchase plan,
permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through
the second quarter of 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the first quarter of 2021.

(1)The tax impact of each component of AOCI is calculated using an effective
tax rate of approximately 25%.

(2)Reclassification amount is recognized in net interest income in the
consolidated statements of income.

(3)Reclassification amount is recognized in securities gains (losses), net in
the consolidated statements of income.

(4)Reclassification amount is recognized in other non-interest expense in the
consolidated statements of income. Additionally, these accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) components are included in the computation of net
periodic pension cost (see Note 18 for additional details).

NOTE 16. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per common
share and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31:

________

(1) Certain per share amounts may not appear to reconcile due to rounding.

The effect from the assumed exercise of 7 million, 7 million and 6 million in
stock options, restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was not
included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share
because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per
common share.

NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Regions administers long-term incentive compensation plans that permit the
granting of incentive awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock
awards, performance awards and stock appreciation rights. While Regions has
the ability to issue stock appreciation rights, none have been issued to date.
The terms of all awards issued under these plans are determined by the CHR
Committee of the Board; however, no awards may be granted after the tenth
anniversary from the date the plans were initially approved by shareholders.
Incentive awards usually vest based on employee service, generally within 3
years from the date of the grant. The contractual lives of options granted
under these plans are typically ten years from the date of the grant.

On April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the Regions
Financial Corporation 2015 LTIP, which permits the Company to grant to
employees and directors various forms of incentive compensation. These forms
of incentive compensation are similar to the types of compensation approved in
prior plans. The 2015 LTIP authorizes 60 million common share equivalents
available for grant, where grants of options and grants of full value awards
(e.g., shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
stock units) count as one share equivalent. Unless otherwise determined by the
CHR Committee of the Board, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock
units, and performance stock units accrue dividends, or their notional
equivalent, as they are declared by the Board, and are paid upon vesting of
the award. Upon adoption of the 2015 LTIP, Regions closed the prior long-term
incentive plan to new grants, and, accordingly, prospective grants must be
made under the 2015 LTIP or a successor plan. All existing grants under prior
long-term incentive plans are unaffected by adoption of the 2015 LTIP. The
number of remaining share equivalents available for future issuance under the
2015 LTIP was approximately 33 million at December 31, 2020.

Grants of performance-based restricted stock typically have a three-year
performance period, and shares vest within three years after the grant date.
Restricted stock units typically have a vesting period of three years.
Grantees of restricted stock awards or units must either remain employed with
the Company for certain periods from the date of grant in order for shares to

be released or issued or retire after meeting the standards of a retiree, at
which time shares would be issued and released. The terms of these plans
generally stipulate that the exercise price of options may not be less than
the fair market value of Regions' common stock at the date the options are
granted. Regions issues new shares from authorized reserves upon exercise.

The following table summarizes the elements of compensation cost recognized in
the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:

respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from
options exercised totaled $1 million for 2020, $2 million for 2019, and $4
million for 2018.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS

During 2020, 2019 and 2018, Regions made restricted stock grants that vest
upon satisfaction of service conditions and restricted stock award and
performance stock award grants that vest based upon service conditions and
performance conditions. Incremental shares earned above the performance target
associated with previous performance stock awards are included when and if
performance targets are achieved. Dividend payments during the vesting period
are deferred to the end of the vesting term. The fair value of these
restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance stock units was
estimated based upon the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of
the grant. The valuation was not adjusted for the deferral of dividends.

NOTE 18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Regions' defined benefit pension plans cover only certain employees as the
pension plans are closed to new entrants. Benefits under the pension plans are
based on years of service and the employee's highest five consecutive years of
compensation during the last ten years of employment. Regions' funding policy
is to contribute annually at least the amount required by IRS minimum funding
standards. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the
future.

The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a non-qualified pension plan that
provides certain senior executive officers defined benefits in relation to
their compensation. Actuarially determined pension expense is charged to
current operations using the projected unit credit method. All defined benefit
plans are referred to as "the plans" throughout the remainder of this
footnote.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified plans was $2.3 billion
and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total plan
assets exceeded the corresponding accumulated benefit obligation for the
qualified plans as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The accumulated benefit
obligation for the non-qualified plans was $188 million and $171 million as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which exceeded all corresponding
plan assets for each period. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the actuarial
(gains) losses related to the change in the benefit obligation were primarily
driven by changes in the discount rate.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension
(benefit) cost for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Regions utilizes a disaggregated approach in the estimation of the service and
interest components of net periodic pension costs by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit
obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This provides a more precise
measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between
projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates.

The expected long-term rate of return on the qualified plans' assets is based
on an estimated reasonable range of probable returns. The assumption is
established by considering historical and anticipated return of the asset
classes invested in by the qualified plans and the allocation strategy
currently in place among those classes. Management chose a point within the
range based on the probability of achievement combined with incremental
returns attributable to active management. For 2021, the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is 5.87 percent.

The qualified plans' investment strategy is continuing to shift from focusing
on maximizing asset returns to minimizing funding ratio volatility, with a
planned increase in the allocation to fixed income securities. The combined
target asset allocation is 50 percent equities, 38 percent fixed income
securities and 12 percent in all other types of investments. Equity securities
include investments in large and small/mid cap companies primarily located in
the U.S., international equities, and private equities. Fixed income
securities include investments in corporate and government bonds, asset-backed
securities and any other fixed income investments as allowed by respective
prospectuses and other offering documents. Other types of investments may
include hedge funds and real estate funds that follow several different
strategies. The plans' assets are highly diversified with respect to asset
class, security and manager. Investment risk is controlled with the plans'
assets rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual
monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment
guidelines established with each investment manager.

Regions' qualified plans have a portion of their investments in Regions'
common stock. At December 31, 2020, the plans held 2,855,618 shares, which
represents a total market value of approximately $46 million, or approximately
2 percent of the plans' assets.

__________

(1)In accordance with accounting guidance, investments that are measured at
fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical
expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. The
fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit
reconciliation of amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy to amounts
reported on the balance sheet.

For all investments, the plans attempt to use quoted market prices of
identical assets on active exchanges, or Level 1 measurements. Where such
quoted market prices are not available, the plans typically employ quoted
market prices of similar instruments (including matrix pricing) and/or
discounted cash flows to estimate a value of these securities, or Level 2
measurements. Level 2 discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on
market interest rates, prepayment speeds and/or option adjusted spreads.

Investments held in the plans consist of cash and cash equivalents, fixed
income securities, equity securities, collective trust funds, hedge funds,
real estate funds, private equity and other assets and are recorded at fair
value on a recurring basis. See Note 1 for a description of valuation
methodologies related to U.S. Treasuries, federal agency securities, and
equity securities. The methodology described in Note 1 for other debt
securities is applicable to corporate bonds.

Mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on
active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. Collective trust
funds, hedge funds, real estate funds, private equity funds and other assets
are valued based on net asset value or the valuation of the limited partner's
portion of the equity of the fund. Third party fund managers provide these
valuations based primarily on estimated valuations of underlying investments.

OTHER PLANS

Regions has a defined-contribution 401(k) plan that includes a Company match
of eligible employee contributions. Eligible employees include those who have
been employed for one year and have worked a minimum of 1,000 hours. The
Company match is invested based on the employees' allocation elections.
Regions provides an automatic 2 percent cash 401(k) contribution to eligible
employees regardless of whether or not they are contributing to the 401(k)
plan. To receive this contribution, employees must be employed at the end of
the year and not actively accruing a benefit in the Regions' pension plans.
Regions' cash contribution was approximately $19 million for 2020, $17 million
for 2019 and $18 million for 2018. For 2020 and 2019, eligible employees who
were already contributing to the 401(k) plan received up to a 5 percent
Company match plus the automatic 2 percent cash contribution. In 2018,
eligible employees who were already contributing to the 401(k) plan received
up to a 4 percent Company match plus the automatic 2 percent cash
contribution. Regions' match to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled
$62 million in 2020, $58 million in 2019, and $48 million in 2018. Regions'
401(k) plan held 20 million shares and 21 million shares of Regions' common
stock at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 401(k) plan received
approximately $12 million, $13 million and $10 million in dividends on
Regions' common stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively.

Regions also sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
cover certain retired employees. For these certain employees retiring before
normal retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the costs of
certain health care benefits until the retired employee becomes eligible for
Medicare. Certain retirees, participating in plans of acquired entities, are
offered a Medicare supplemental benefit. The plan is contributory and contains
other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments. Retiree
health care benefits, as well as similar benefits for active employees, are
provided through a self-insured program in which Company and retiree costs are
based on the amount of benefits paid. The Company's policy is to fund the
Company's share of the cost of health care benefits in amounts determined at
the discretion of management. Postretirement life insurance is also provided
to a grandfathered group of employees and retirees.

Note: The table above does not include total income tax expense from
discontinued operations of zero, zero, and $80 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. The deferred income tax expense reflected in discontinued
operations was zero, zero and $43 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively.

On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, Tax
Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from 35
percent to 21 percent. During 2018, the Company made the determination to and
completed administrative filings with the Internal Revenue Service that
allowed it to accelerate various deductions into the prior year. As a result,
the Company recognized during the 2018 measurement period approximately $37
million in tax benefits due to Tax Reform. The measurement period ended in
December 2018.

Income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized losses on
securities transferred to held to maturity, unrealized gains and losses on
securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivative
instruments and the net change from defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement benefits. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on
shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company accounts for investment tax credits using the deferral method.
Investment tax credits generated totaled $94 million, $59 million and $90
million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

________

(1)N/A indicates that net operating losses with no expiration are not measured
on a pre-tax basis.

(2) Federal and state deferred tax assets of $25 million and $2 million,
respectively, related to net operating losses were acquired as part of the
Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition. While the federal net
operating losses are subject to certain annual utilization limits, the Company
has determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary based on projected
annual limitation and the length of the net operating loss carryover period.

The Company's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset
is based on its assessment of all available positive and negative evidence. At
December 31, 2020, positive evidence supporting the realization of the
deferred tax assets includes a history of positive earnings with no history of
significant tax carryforwards expiring unused. In addition, the reversal of
taxable temporary differences, excluding goodwill and the inclusion of the
accretion of taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases
acquired in a previous business combination, will offset approximately $1.2
billion of the gross deferred tax assets, which is significantly larger than
the $785 million deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance at
December 31, 2020.

The Company believes that a portion of the state net operating loss
carryforwards will not be realized due to the length of certain state
carryforward periods. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established
in the amount of $31 million against such benefits at December 31, 2020
compared to $32 million at December 31, 2019.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows:

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns. The
Company is in the IRS's Compliance Assurance Process program. Pursuant to this
program, examinations for tax years through 2018 have been completed. Also,
with few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local
income tax examinations for tax years before 2016. The completion of tax
examinations was the primary reason for the reduction in unrecognized tax
benefits in 2020. Currently, there are no material disputed tax positions with
federal or state taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company does not
anticipate that any adjustments relating to federal or state tax examinations
will result in material changes to its business, financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

As a result of the potential resolution of certain federal and state income
tax positions, it is reasonably possible that the UTBs could decrease as much
as $4 million during the next twelve months, since resolved items will be
removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or
recognition in earnings.

As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the balances of the Company's UTBs
that would reduce the effective tax rates, if recognized, were $9 million, $34
million and $10 million, respectively. The remainder of the UTB balance has
indirect tax benefits in other jurisdictions or is the tax effect of temporary
differences.

Income tax expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018, includes an immaterial expense
(benefit) for interest expense, interest income and penalties before the
impact of any applicable federal and state deductions. As of December 31, 2020
and 2019, the Company had an immaterial liability for interest and penalties
related to income taxes, before the impact of any applicable federal and state
deductions.

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Estimated fair value includes premium of approximately $83 million as of
December 31, 2020 and $108 million as of December 31, 2019 to be amortized
over the remaining life. Approximately $15 million of the decrease since
December 31, 2019 related to hedges that were terminated during the third
quarter of 2020 and were not amortized into earnings as of the date of
termination.

(3)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

(4)The gain amounts, which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or
reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other
derivative positions. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, financial
instruments posted of $24 million, for both periods, were not offset in the
consolidated balance sheets.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies for
derivatives is described in Note 1.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the

163

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

Company's fixed-rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements
involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate
interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors. As of December 31, 2020, Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions through 2026 and
a small portion of these hedges are forward starting.

The following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges
on AOCI. The balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI will be amortized
into earnings through 2026.

Included in this amount is $26 million in pre-tax net gains related to the
amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges.

During 2020 and 2019, the Company had terminated fair value hedges related to
debt securities available for sale with carrying values of $301 million and
$337 million, respectively. The remaining basis adjustments related to these
terminated hedges were $1 million and $3 million, respectively.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, Regions had $924 million and $366 million,
respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock commitments.
Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage
loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments. Residential
mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are
recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair value based on
management's election. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Regions had $1.9 billion
and $662 million, respectively, in total notional amounts related to these
forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate
lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to
residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-
to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward
sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans are included in capital
markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair market value with
any changes to fair value being recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with
the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using
various derivative instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments,
futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in
the fair value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of
income. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $4.1 billion and $4.8 billion respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2021 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2020 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of December 31, 2020 was approximately $552 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at December 31, 2020 and
2019 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection,
recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is
available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $74 million and $64 million, respectively,
for which Regions had posted collateral of $74 million and $67 million,
respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 22. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis as of December 31:

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for residential mortgage
servicing rights, which are the only material assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 7.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
mortgage loans and certain commercial loans originated with the intent to
sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the changes in fair
values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge
them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge
accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other loans held
for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative
instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based
on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted
cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities
that include servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans
held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also elected to measure certain commercial and industrial loans
held for sale at fair value, as these loans are actively traded in the
secondary market. The Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for
substantially all of these loans through a third party valuation service that
is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans are traded in
the market, the volume and level of trading activity is subject to variability
and the loans are not exchange-traded. The balance of these loans held for
sale was immaterial at December 31, 2020.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value at December 31:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income for
the years presented. These changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic
hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to
changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

NOTE 23. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised.

The Corporate Bank segment represents the Company's commercial banking
functions including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and
investor real estate lending. This segment also includes equipment lease
financing, as well as capital markets activities, which include securities
underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, foreign exchange,
derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Corporate
Bank customers include corporate, middle market, and commercial real estate
developers and investors. Corresponding deposit products related to these
types of customers are also included in this segment.

The Consumer Bank segment represents the Company's branch network, including
consumer banking products and services related to residential first mortgages,
home equity lines and loans, branch small business loans, indirect loans,
consumer credit cards and other consumer loans, as well as the corresponding
deposit relationships. These services are also provided through the Company's
digital channels and contact center.

The Wealth Management segment offers individuals, businesses, governmental
institutions and non-profit entities a wide range of solutions to help
protect, grow and transfer wealth. Offerings include credit related products,
trust and investment management, asset management, retirement and savings
solutions and estate planning.

Discontinued operations includes all brokerage and investment activities
associated with the sale of Morgan Keegan which closed on April 2, 2012, as
well as the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates,
which closed on July 2, 2018. See Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" for related
discussion.

Other includes the Company's Treasury function, the securities portfolio,
wholesale funding activities, interest rate risk management activities and
other corporate functions that are not related to a strategic business unit.
Also within Other are certain reconciling items in order to translate the
segment results that are based on management accounting practices into
consolidated results. Management accounting practices utilized by Regions as
the basis of presentation for segment results include the following:

•Net interest income is presented based upon an FTP approach, for which
market-based funding charges/credits are assigned within the segments. By
allocating a cost or a credit to each product based on the FTP framework,
management is able to more effectively measure the net interest margin
contribution of its assets/liabilities by segment. The summation of the
interest income/expense and FTP charges/credits for each segment is its
designated net interest income and other financing income. The variance
between the Company's cumulative FTP charges and cumulative FTP credits is
offset in Other.

•Provision for credit losses is allocated to each segment based on an
estimated loss methodology. The difference between the consolidated provision
for credit losses and the segments' estimated loss is reflected in Other.

•Income tax expense (benefit) is calculated for the Corporate Bank, Consumer
Bank and Wealth Management based on a consistent federal and state statutory
rate. Discontinued Operations reflects the actual income tax expense (benefit)
of its results. Any difference between the Company's consolidated income tax
expense (benefit) and the segments' calculated amounts is reflected in Other.

•Management reporting allocations of certain expenses are made in order to
analyze the financial performance of the segments. These allocations consist
of operational and overhead cost pools and are intended to represent the total
costs to support a segment.

(1)Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses
is the sum of the provision for loans losses and the provision for unfunded
credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded
commitments was included in other non-interest expense.

NOTE 24. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Credit risk associated with these instruments as of December 31 is represented
by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2020| | 2019  
| (In millions)  
Unused commitments to extend credit| $| 56,644 | | | $| 52,976 |  
Standby letters of credit| 1,742 | | | 1,521 |  
Commercial letters of credit| 132 | | | 59 |  
Liabilities associated with standby letters of credit| 25 | | | 22 |  
Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 25 | | | 23 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 126| | 45 |  
  
Unused commitments to extend credit--To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to
consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among
others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan
commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to
expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements.

Standby letters of credit--Standby letters of credit are also issued to
customers which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if
certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the
customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby
letter of credit. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees
is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as
such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. Historically, a large
percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The
contractual amount of standby letters of credit represents the maximum
potential amount of future payments Regions could be required to make and
represents Regions' maximum credit risk.

Commercial letters of credit--Commercial letters of credit are issued to
facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general
rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in
transit.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
December 31, 2020, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably
possible estimate includes a legal contingency that is subject to an
indemnification agreement.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves

174

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter
involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or
is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. As previously disclosed,
Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the CFPB into certain of
Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional inquiries will arise
from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries
could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or
enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material
effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments,
findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

As discussed in Note 3, on April 2, 2012 ("Closing Date"), Regions closed the
sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection
with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters
related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the
Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses
under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for
judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution
of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments
that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is
indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. As of
December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of the indemnification
obligation were immaterial.

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal
balance for the majority of its DUS servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2020
and 2019, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $4.5
billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable
contingent liability related to its loss share guarantee was approximately
$1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The
Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services
for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to
default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be
without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $5 million and $4 million at December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.

VISA INDEMNIFICATION

As a member of the Visa USA network, Regions, along with other members,
indemnified Visa USA against litigation. On October 3, 2007, Visa USA was
restructured and acquired several Visa affiliates. In conjunction with this
restructuring, Regions' indemnification of Visa USA was modified to cover
specific litigation ("covered litigation").

A portion of Visa's proceeds from its IPO was put into escrow to fund the
covered litigation. To the extent that the amount available under the escrow
arrangement, or subsequent fundings of the escrow account resulting from
reductions in the class B share conversion ratio, is insufficient to fully
resolve the covered litigation, Visa will enforce the indemnification
obligations of Visa USA's members for any excess amount. At this time, Regions
has concluded that it is not probable that covered litigation exposure will
exceed the class B share value.

NOTE 25. REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services
is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or
services. Refer to Note 1 for descriptions of the accounting and reporting
policies related to revenue recognition.

_________

(1)In the third quarter of 2020, the equity investee executed an initial
public offering. The Company was subject to a conventional post-issuance 180
day lock-up period, which prevented the sale of its position until January
2021. The Company sold its position in January 2021 and recognized an
immaterial gain.

(2)This revenue is not impacted by the accounting guidance adopted in 2018 and
continues to be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company's prior
revenue recognition policy.

Regions elected the practical expedient related to contract costs and will
continue to expense sales commissions and any related contract costs when
incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.

Regions also elected the practical expedient related to remaining performance
obligations and therefore did not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations for 1) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less and 2) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the
amount to which Regions has the right to invoice for services performed.
