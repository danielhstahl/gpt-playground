Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical
information, but rather are related to future operations, strategies,
financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based
on management's current expectations as well as certain assumptions and
estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the
statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are
subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are
likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections
expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any
of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other
factors include, but are not limited to, those described below:

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions" or the "Company") provides a full
range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the
South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial
institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other
adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all
information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a
complete presentation of financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items,
necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
have been included. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in
Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and
disclosure through the filing date of this Form 10-Q.

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Holdings, Inc.
The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. Regions sold Morgan Keegan and related
affiliates in April 2012\. See Note 2 and Note 13 for related disclosure.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance related to several
accounting topics. The cumulative effect of the retrospective application was
a total reduction to retained earnings of $2 million, of which the individual
components were immaterial. All prior period amounts impacted by guidance that
required retrospective application have been revised. See Note 15 for related
disclosure.

NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. The gain associated
with the transaction amounted to $281 million ($196 million after-tax).

In connection with the agreement, the results of the entities sold are
reported in the Company's consolidated statements of income separately as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The transaction closed
on April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. (formerly known as
Morgan Asset Management, Inc.) and Regions Trust were not included in the
sale. In connection with the closing of the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify
Raymond James for all litigation matters related to pre-closing activities.
See Note 13 for related disclosure.

Results of operations for the Morgan Keegan entities sold are presented
separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the
consolidated statements of income. This presentation is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The following table represents the condensed results of operations for the
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. entities sold as discontinued operations:

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 1,059 at December 31, 2017 to 1,459 at September
30, 2018. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2017 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented an
OTTI as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not
more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions
before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating OTTI, management did
identify a limited number of positions where an OTTI was believed to exist as
of September 30, 2018.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale from continuing operations are shown in the table below.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

securities gains of $4 million recognized during the third quarter of 2017.

  

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Effective January 1, 2018, Regions adopted new accounting guidance that
requires equity investments to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in net income. Regions elected a measurement alternative to
fair value for certain equity investments without a readily determinable fair
value. See Note 15 for related disclosure.

Marketable equity securities carried at fair value, which primarily consist of
assets held for certain employee benefits and money market funds, are reported
in other earning assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Total marketable
equity securities were $475 million and $414 million at September 30, 2018 and
December 31, 2017, respectively. Net unrealized holding gains for marketable
equity securities were $7 million at September 30, 2018.

Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value primarily consist
of investments in strategic partners and certain CRA projects. The carrying
amount of equity investments measured under the measurement alternative,
downward and upward adjustments for impairments and price changes from
observable transactions are as follows:

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2017, for a description of the methodology.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by
portfolio segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and
2017. The total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio
ending balances are disaggregated to detail the amounts derived through
individual evaluation and collective evaluation for impairment. The allowance
for loan losses related to individually evaluated loans is attributable to
reserves for non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and all
TDRs. The allowance for loan losses and the loan portfolio ending balances
related to collectively evaluated loans is attributable to the remainder of
the portfolio.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the
portfolio segments.

Commercial--The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and
industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations
to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion
projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans

  

20

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction
of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the
creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from
customers' business operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in
commodity prices.

Investor Real Estate--Loans for real estate development are repaid through
cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This
portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or
investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income
generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real
estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product
types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions' markets.
Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such
as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping
centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the
valuation of real estate.

Consumer--The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage,
home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card,
and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to
consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15
to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their
primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and
lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second
mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the
equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or
line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in
addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses.
Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale
lending through third parties. Consumer credit card lending includes Regions
branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer loans include other
revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in
this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer
economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The following tables present credit quality indicators for portfolio segments
and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of September 30, 2018, and
December 31, 2017. Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are
detailed by categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of
default. Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the
relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis
or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the
borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories
are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Pass--includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Special Mention--includes obligations that have potential weakness that may,
if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the
Company's position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also
be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an
adverse effect on debt service ability;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Substandard Accrual--includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness
that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently
performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility
that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not
corrected;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Non-accrual--includes obligations where management has determined that full
payment of principal and interest is in doubt.  
  
Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to
as "classified." Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans
are often collectively referred to as "criticized and classified." Classes in
the consumer portfolio segment are disaggregated by accrual status.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 6 "Allowance For Credit Losses" in the 2017 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's TDRs.

Further discussion related to TDRs, including their impact on the allowance
for loan losses and designation of TDRs in periods subsequent to the
modification is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Defaulted TDRs

The following table presents, by portfolio segment and class, TDRs that
defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017,
and that were modified in the previous twelve months (i.e., the twelve months
prior to the default). For purposes of this disclosure, default is defined as
placement on non-accrual status for the commercial and investor real estate
portfolio segments, and 90 days past due and still accruing for the consumer
portfolio segment. Consideration of defaults in the calculation of the
allowance for loan losses is described in detail in the consolidated financial
statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

Commercial and investor real estate loans that were on non-accrual status at
the time of the latest modification are not included in the default table
above, as they are already considered to be in default at the time of the
restructuring. At September 30, 2018, approximately $66 million of commercial
and investor real estate loans modified in a TDR during the three months ended
September 30, 2018 were on non-accrual status. Approximately 39 percent of
this amount was 90 days past due.

At September 30, 2018, Regions had restructured binding unfunded commitments
totaling $8 million where a concession was granted and the borrower was in
financial difficulty.

NOTE 5. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

(1) "Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns.

  

On April 28, 2017, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately
$2.7 billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $30 million.

  

On July 31, 2018, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately
$3.4 billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $42 million.

  

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of residential MSRs is calculated without changing any other
assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The
derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the estimated
impacts to fair value included in the table above.

The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible assets
associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee associated
with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the
2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Also see Note 13
herein for additional information related to the guarantee.

As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the DUS servicing portfolio
was approximately $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The related
commercial MSRs were valued at approximately $52 million and $48 million at
September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The estimated fair
value of the loss share guarantee was valued at approximately $4 million at
both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

The goodwill allocated to the Wealth Management reportable segment decreased
due to the sale of Regions Insurance Group in the third quarter of 2018. See
Note 2 for related disclosure.

Regions evaluates each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment on an annual
basis in the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying value. A detailed description of the Company's methodology
and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each
reporting unit is included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adverse
changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors
could result in a decline in the implied fair value of goodwill.

During the third quarter of 2018, Regions assessed events and circumstances
for all three reporting units as of September 30, 2018, and through the date
of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that could potentially
indicate goodwill impairment. The indicators assessed included:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Recent operating performance,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in market capitalization,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Regulatory actions and assessments,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors, and
competition),  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset
impairments, and business dispositions), and  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Trends in the banking industry.  
  
After assessing the indicators noted above, Regions determined that it was not
more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units had
declined below their carrying value as of September 30, 2018. Therefore,
Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for
each of Regions' reporting units for the September 30, 2018 interim period.

treatment event for the Series A preferred stock or at any time following a
regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared $24 million in cash dividends on both Series A
and Series B Preferred Stock during the first nine months of 2018 and 2017.

In the event Series A and Series B preferred shares are redeemed at the
liquidation amounts, $113 million and $67 million excess of the redemption
amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively.
Approximately $100 million of Series A preferred dividends that were recorded
as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately $13 million of related
issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to
common shareholders. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred dividends
that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related
surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and
approximately $15 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.
As part of the Company's capital plan, the Board authorized a new $2.031
billion common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the
beginning of the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.
This plan is inclusive of the capital generated from the sale of Regions
Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates (see Note 2). The capital plan
included a proposed increase of the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14
per common share that began in the third quarter of 2018.

As of September 30, 2018, Regions has repurchased 59.6 million shares of
common stock under the 2018 capital plan at a total cost of approximately $1.3
billion. The common share repurchases and total cost paid include amounts
related to a contractual repurchase agreement entered into on August 27, 2018,
through which the Company made a payment of $700 million, and received an
initial delivery of approximately 29.1 million shares, representing
approximately 80 percent of the total value of the transaction. The final
number of shares repurchased is based on the volume-weighted average stock
price of the Company's common stock during the term of the transaction, less a
discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the agreement. These shares
were immediately retired upon repurchase and, therefore, are not included in
treasury stock. The counterparty to the Company's contractual repurchase
agreement completed the transaction on October 24, 2018, and final settlement
resulted in an additional delivery of 8.8 million shares of common stock on
October 29, 2018. The Company also continued open market share repurchases
under the capital plan in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of November 6, 2018,
Regions had repurchased approximately 25.3 million shares of common stock at a
total cost of approximately $274.5 million. All of these shares were
immediately retired upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in
treasury stock.

Prior to the new common stock repurchase plan, Regions had authorization to
repurchase $1.47 billion in common shares. As of June 30, 2018, Regions had
repurchased approximately 90.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost
of approximately $1.47 billion under this plan and concluded the plan during
the second quarter of 2018.

Regions' Board declared a cash dividend for third quarter of 2018 of $0.14 per
share and $0.09 per common share for both the second and first quarters of
2018, totaling $0.32 per common share for the first nine months of 2018. The
Board declared $0.09 per common share for the third quarter of 2017 as
compared to $0.07 per common share for the second quarter of 2017 and $0.065
per common share for the first quarter of 2017, respectively, totaling $0.225
per common share for the first nine months of 2017.

Certain per share amounts may not appear to reconcile due to rounding.  
  
The effect from the assumed exercise of 5 million and 6 million stock options,
restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, was not included in
the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such
amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.
The effect from the assumed exercise of 14 million and 15 million stock
options, restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, was not included
in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (credit) is recorded
in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

Regions' funding policy for the qualified plans is to contribute annually at
least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made a
contribution of $100 million for the 2017 plan year during the first quarter
of 2018. Regions also made a contribution of $75 million for the 2017 plan
year during the third quarter of 2017.

Regions also provides other postretirement benefits such as defined benefit
health care plans and life insurance plans that cover certain retired
employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on
the consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2018 or 2017.

Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives in
a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets. There is no fair value presented for contracts that are characterized
as settled daily.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
(2)

|

Estimated fair value includes premium and change in fair value of the interest
rate floors.

As of September 30, 2018, financial instruments posted of $24 million were not
offset in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017, cash
collateral posted of $257 million and financial instruments posted of $50
million were not offset in the consolidated balance sheets.  
  
HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors.

Regions recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of $55 million and $130
million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2018
and 2017, respectively, related to terminated cash flow hedges of loan
instruments, which will be amortized into earnings in conjunction with the
recognition of interest payments through 2025. Regions recognized pre-tax
income of $10 million and $16 million during the three months ended September
30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and pre-tax income of $39 million and $53
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges of
loan instruments.

Regions expects to reclassify out of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and into earnings approximately $34 million in pre-tax expense due to
the receipt or payment of interest payments on all cash flow hedges within the
next twelve months. Included in this amount is $18 million in pre-tax net
income related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges. The
maximum length of time over which Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately
seven years as of September 30, 2018, and a portion of these hedges are
forward starting.

The following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on
the consolidated statements of income:

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income and other) and included in other assets and other
liabilities, as appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Regions had $318 million and $197
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At September 30, 2018 and December 31,
2017, Regions had $569 million and $481 million, respectively, in total
notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-
to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward
sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in
mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock
commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial
mortgage loans are included in capital markets fee income and other.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Concurrent with
the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using
various derivative instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments,
futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in
the fair value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of
income. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional
amount related to these contracts was $5.3 billion and $4.8 billion,
respectively.

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss)
recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in
the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2018 and 2017:

Credit risk, defined as all positive exposures not collateralized with cash or
other assets or reserved for, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017,
totaled approximately $102 million and $251 million, respectively. These
amounts represent the net credit risk on all trading and other derivative
positions held by Regions.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2018 and 2026.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2018 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of September 30, 2018 was approximately $488 million. This scenario would only
occur if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties
defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at September
30, 2018 and 2017 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold
credit protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap
transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, were $66 million and $91 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $66 million and $90
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Marketable equity securities and
debt securities available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from
Level 3 valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability
of inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as
if they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2018
and December 31, 2017:

Marketable equity securities were reclassified from trading account securities
and securities available for sale to other earning assets, beginning in the
first quarter of 2018, with the adoption of new accounting guidance. Prior

With the adoption of new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018,
equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are required to
be adjusted prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price
transaction for a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs.  
  
Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for all material assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net changes in realized gains (losses)
included in earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities held at
September 30, 2018 and 2017 are not material.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 5. See Note 5 for these amounts
and additional disclosures related to assumptions used in the fair value
calculation for MSRs.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all FNMA and FHLMC eligible
residential mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated
with the intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of
the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. These
changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An
immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-
specific credit risk.

Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company relies on a robust, cross-functional
corporate governance program to make adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. In
the current whole loan market, financial investors are generally requiring a
higher rate of return than the return inherent in loans if held to maturity.
The fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at
September 30, 2018 was $1.2 billion or 1.5 percent.

NOTE 12. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. Additional
information about the Company's reportable segments is included in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised.

Discontinued operations includes all brokerage and investment activities
associated with the sale of Morgan Keegan which closed on April 2, 2012, as
well as the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates,
which closed on July 2, 2018. See Note 2 "Discontinued Operations" for related
discussion.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

Unused commitments to extend credit--To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to
consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among
others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan
commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to
expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements.

Standby letters of credit--Standby letters of credit are also issued to
customers, which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if
certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the
customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby
letter of credit. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of
credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters
of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions
could be required to make and represents Regions' maximum credit risk.

Commercial letters of credit--Commercial letters of credit are issued to
facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general
rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in
transit.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted

  

51

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

as circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies,
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

In addition, Regions has agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal
matters resulting from pre-closing activities in conjunction with the sale of
Morgan Keegan and recorded an indemnification obligation at fair value in the
second quarter of 2012.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
September 30, 2018, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves, will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably
possible estimate includes legal contingencies that are subject to the
indemnification agreement with Raymond James.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not
complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

In July 2006, Morgan Keegan and a former Morgan Keegan analyst were named as
defendants in a lawsuit filed by a Canadian insurance and financial services
company and its American subsidiary in the Circuit Court of Morris County, New
Jersey. Plaintiffs alleged civil claims under the RICO Act and claims for
commercial disparagement, tortious interference with contractual
relationships, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and
common law conspiracy. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants engaged in a multi-
year conspiracy to publish and disseminate false and defamatory information
about plaintiffs to improperly drive down plaintiffs' stock price, so that
others could profit from short positions. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants'
actions damaged their reputations and harmed their business relationships.
Plaintiffs sought monetary damages for a number of categories of alleged
damages, including lost insurance business, lost financings and increased
financing costs, increased audit fees and directors and officers insurance
premiums and lost acquisitions. In September 2012, the trial court dismissed
the case with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal, and in April 2017, the
appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims under the
RICO Act. The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the
commercial disparagement and tortious interference claims and remanded those
claims but limited the plaintiffs' damages. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with
the Supreme Court of New Jersey in May 2017, and in October 2017, that court
denied the plaintiffs' petition and remanded the case to the trial court. On
September 4, 2018, the parties settled all remaining claims. The settlement
did not have a material effect on Regions' financial position, results of
operations or cash flows as Regions had previously accrued liabilities to
substantially cover this matter. This matter was subject to the
indemnification agreement with Raymond James.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. Additional inquiries will
arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The
inquiries, including those described below, could develop into administrative,
civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that could result in
consequences that have a material effect on Regions' consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. Such consequences
could include adverse judgments, findings, settlements, penalties, fines,
orders, injunctions, restitution, or alterations in our business practices,
and could result in additional expenses and collateral costs, including
reputational damage.

Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the United States Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York pertaining to Regions' banking
relationship with a former customer and accounts maintained by related
entities and individuals affiliated with the customer who may be involved in
criminal activity, as well as related aspects of Regions' Anti-Money
Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be

GUARANTEES

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

As discussed in Note 2, on April 2, 2012 ("Closing Date"), Regions closed the
sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection
with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters
related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the
Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses
under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for
judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution
of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments
that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is
indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. As of
September 30, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the indemnification
obligation were immaterial.

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017,
the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $3.2 billion and
$2.9 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability
related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $1.0 billion and $923
million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company
would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for
Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default
and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without
value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $4 million at both September 30, 2018 and December
31, 2017. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2017, for additional information.

NOTE 14. REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services
is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or
services. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2017, for descriptions of the accounting and reporting
policies related to revenue recognition.

The following tables present total non-interest income disaggregated by major
product category for each reportable segment for the period indicated.

This revenue is not impacted by the new accounting guidance and continues to
be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company's existing revenue
recognition policy.

Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective
method.  
  
Regions elected the practical expedient related to contract costs and will
continue to expense sales commissions and any related contract costs when
incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.

Regions also elected the practical expedient related to remaining performance
obligations and therefore did not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations for 1) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less and 2) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the
amount to which Regions has the right to invoice for services performed.

ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers

|

This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,
Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
Industry topics of the Codification. The core principle of the ASU is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
ASU may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective
basis.

  

|

January 1, 2018  

  

|

Regions adopted the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018 using
the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, approximately
$1.3 billion of non-interest income is within the scope of the new revenue
recognition standard and includes service charges on deposit accounts, card
and ATM fees, investment management and trust fee income, capital markets fee
income, investment services fee income and other components within non-
interest income. Income streams that are out of scope of the new standard
include interest income, mortgage income, securities gains (losses), bank-
owned life insurance and certain other components within non-interest income.
Regions also developed additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures
required by the new revenue recognition standard. See Note 14.

ASU 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments

  

ASU 2018-04, Debt Securities and Regulated Operations

|

This ASU amends ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments-Overall, and addresses
certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
financial instruments. Among other minor amendments applicable to Regions, the
main provisions require investments in equity securities to be measured at
fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income unless
they qualify for a practicability exception (excludes investments accounted
for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in
consolidation of the investee). Except for disclosure requirements that have
been adopted prospectively, the ASU must be adopted on a modified
retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2018

  

  

  

|

The adoption of this guidance resulted in trading account assets and equity
securities available for sale being reclassified to other earning assets. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. See Note 3.

  

  
  
  
ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

|

This ASU amends Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and provides clarification
with respect to classification within the statement of cash flows where
current guidance is unclear or silent. The ASU must be adopted
retrospectively.

ASU 2017-05, Other Income- Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of
Nonfinancial Assets

  

  

  

|

This ASU amends Subtopic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the
Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets, to clarify the scope and to add guidance
for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The new standard adds a definition
for in-substance nonfinancial assets and clarifies that nonfinancial assets
within a legal entity are within the scope of ASC 606. This ASU may be adopted
either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2018

  

  

|

Regions adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.

ASU 2017-07, Compensation- Retirement Benefits

  

|

This ASU amends Topic 715, Retirement Benefits, and provides more prescriptive
guidance around the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement
benefit cost in the income statement. The amendment requires that the service
cost component be disaggregated from other components of net periodic benefit
cost in the income statement. The ASU must be adopted retrospectively.

|

January 1, 2018  

|

Regions recorded the service cost component of net periodic pension and
postretirement benefit cost in salaries and employee benefits in the income
statement. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement
benefit cost were recorded in other non-interest expense. The third quarter
and first nine months of 2017 have been revised to conform to this
presentation. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.
See Note 9.  
  
ASU 2017-09, Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting

  

|

This ASU amends Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, and clarifies when
modification accounting should be applied to changes in terms or conditions of
share-based payment awards. The amendments narrow the scope of modification
accounting by clarifying that modification accounting should be applied to
awards if the change affects the fair value, vesting conditions, or
classification of the award. The amendments do not impact current disclosure
requirements for modifications, regardless of whether modification accounting
is required under the new guidance. The ASU must be adopted prospectively to
modifications that occur on or after the adoption date.

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.

  

  
  
  
ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

  

|

This ASU amends ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging to (1) improve the
transparency and understandability of information conveyed to financial
statement users about an entity's risk management activities by better
aligning the entity's financial reporting for hedging relationships with those
risk management activities and (2) reduce the complexity of and simplify the
application of hedge accounting by preparers. Except for disclosure
requirements that have been adopted prospectively, the ASU must be adopted on
a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2019

  

Early adoption is permitted.

Regions elected to adopt this ASU for financial reporting as of January 1,
2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. See Note
10.

  

  
  
  
ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes

  

|

This ASU amends SEC guidance in the Codification related to income taxes to
reflect the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which provides
guidance for companies that are not able to complete their accounting for the
income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the period of enactment.
The staff believes that to the extent a company can reasonably estimate the
impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, such items should be reported in the
first reporting period in which the Company is able to determine the
reasonable estimate.

  

  

|

Adopted upon issuance.

  

|

Regions does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact.

ASU2018-10, Narrow Amendments to Topic 842

  

ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to Topic 842

  

|

This ASU creates ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The
new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding liability equal to the present value of future rental payments
on their balance sheets for all leases with a term greater than one year.
There are not significant changes to lessor accounting; however, there were
certain improvements made to align lessor accounting with the lessee
accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This
guidance expands both quantitative and qualitative required disclosures. This
ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2019

  

Early adoption is permitted.

|

Regions has established a leasing standard implementation team staffed by
designated personnel from the Corporate Controller's group, Corporate Real
Estate and other business and finance management to plan and execute the
adoption of the new leasing standard.

  

The implementation team has substantially completed the identification of
Regions' leases that will need to be measured and reported as a right-of-use
asset and corresponding liability for future rental payments. The
implementation team is currently working with a lease administration vendor to
set up and test the accounting for the lease contracts on the lease
administration system. Based on preliminary estimates that are subject to
change, Regions has a range of approximately $400-$600 million of future lease
obligations that would be measured and recognized when the new guidance is
adopted (refer to Note 24 to consolidated financial statements included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017). While this
amount represents a large majority of the leases that are within the scope of
the new leasing standard, the implementation team will continue reviewing
service contracts up through the effective date and may identify additional
leases embedded in those arrangements that will be within the scope of the new
standard.

  

Between now and January 1, 2019, Regions will likely have changes to the lease
portfolio as the Company continues to evaluate and execute branch and
occupancy optimization initiatives. The evaluation of the impact of the
standard will be adjusted based on new leases that are executed, leases that
are terminated prior to the effective date, and changes to key assumptions or
expectations such as renewals and extensions, and the interest rates to be
used to discount the future lease obligations.

  

Regions expects to adopt the guidance using the optional transition method,
which allows for a modified retrospective method of adoption with a cumulative
effect adjustment to retained earnings without restating comparable periods.
Regions also plans to elect the relief package of practical expedients for
which there is no requirement to reassess existence of leases, their
classification, and initial direct costs as well as an exemption for short-
term leases with a term of less than one year, whereby Regions does not
recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet but
instead recognizes lease payments as an expense over the lease term as
appropriate.

  

While there will be some changes to income statement classification, the
implementation team does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a
material impact to pre-tax income. Regions does not anticipate early adoption
of the new standard.

ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

|

This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses to replace the
current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss
approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other
commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all
available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect
the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to
collect. The amendments also eliminate the current accounting model for
purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Additional quantitative
and qualitative disclosures are required upon adoption.  
  
While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the
ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit
losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized
cost of the securities by direct write-offs.  
  
The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Entities that
have loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should
prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit
deteriorated assets.

|

January 1, 2020

  

Early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019.

|

Regions' cross-functional implementation team, which is co-led by Finance and
Risk Management, has developed a project plan that results in running a CECL
parallel production during 2019 and the adoption of the standard in the first
quarter of 2020. Key project implementation activities for 2018 focus on model
enhancements, execution and implementation, continued challenge of model
outputs, development of the qualitative framework, establishing processes and
controls, drafting policies and disclosures, data resolution, and
documentation. Regions is currently on track with the project implementation
plan.

  

Regions provides updates to senior leadership and to the Audit Committee and
Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These communications provide an
update on the status of the implementation project plan, results of initial
modeled impacts, and risks identified.

  

Adoption of the standard may result in an overall material increase in the
allowance for credit losses given the change from accounting for losses
inherent in the loan portfolio to accounting for losses over the remaining
contractual life of the portfolio. However, the impact at adoption will be
influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as
well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. Based on initial
modeling, loan portfolios expected to generate the majority of the increase
include longer-dated loans such as residential first mortgages, home equity
lending products and indirect-other products. However, there could be
increases or decreases in the allowance in certain other loan portfolios at
adoption.

  

Regions expects no material allowance on held to maturity securities since the
majority of this portfolio consists of agency-backed securities that
inherently have an immaterial risk of loss. Additionally, Regions expects no
material allowance impact to available for sale securities.  
  
ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

This ASU amends Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, and eliminates Step
2 from the goodwill impairment test.

Early adoption is permitted.

|

Regions believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material

ASU 2017-08, Receivables- Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

|

This ASU amends Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other
Costs, to shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt
securities held at a premium to the earliest call date. Current guidance
generally requires entities to amortize a premium as a yield adjustment over
the contractual life of the instrument. Shortening the amortization period is
generally expected to more closely align the recognition of interest income
with expectations incorporated into the pricing of the underlying securities.
The amendments do not affect the accounting treatment of discounts. This ASU
should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2019  
  
Early adoption permitted, including in an interim period.

|

Regions is evaluating the impact upon adoption; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.  
  
ASU 2018-07,

Compensation - Stock Compensation

  

|

This ASU amends and expands the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services for non-employees. Under this guidance, the accounting for share-
based payments to non-employees and employees will be substantially aligned.
The measurement of equity-classified non-employee awards will now be fixed at
the grant date.

Regions is evaluating the impact upon adoption; however, the impact is not

ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements

  

|

The FASB issued this ASU to clarify, improve, and correct errors in the
Codification. The ASU covers nine amendments, which affect a wide variety of
Topics including business combinations, debt, derivatives and hedging, and
defined contribution pension plans. Some amendments do not require transition
guidance and are effective upon issuance, while others will be applicable for
Regions starting in 2019. However, all amendments are expected to have an
immaterial impact to Regions.

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in the Form 10-K. Effective January 1, 2018,
the Company adopted new accounting guidance and certain prior period amounts
presented in this discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to
current period classifications. See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 15
"Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the consolidated financial statements
for further detail. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2017 for the consolidated statements of income. For
the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion will be the
balances as of September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 5 through 7 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At September 30, 2018, Regions operated 1,455 total branch outlets
across the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions operates under three reportable
business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management with
the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. See Note 12
"Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for
more information regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The sale closed on July 2, 2018. The transaction generated a
$281 million gain ($196 million after tax). On January 11, 2012, Regions
entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related
affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on April 2, 2012. Regions
Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not included in the sale;
they are included in the Wealth Management segment. See Note 2 "Discontinued
Operations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and
other financing income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest
income and other financing income is primarily the difference between the
interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and
securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing
liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions' net interest income
and other financing income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance
sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its
assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Net interest income and other
financing income also includes rental income and depreciation expense
associated with operating leases for which Regions is the lessor. Non-interest
income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM
fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and
trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions
provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan
losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits,
occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance
assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a
competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service
and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient
locations.

THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $548 million,
or $0.50 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $295
million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Net income
available to common shareholders from continuing operations was $354 million,
or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $296 million, or $0.25 per diluted
share, over these same periods. The primary drivers of the increases in
results from the prior year period were a gain on the sale of Regions
Insurance Group reflected in discontinued operations, combined with increased
net interest income and other financing income and decreased income tax
expense. Per share amounts were impacted by share repurchases including an
accelerated share repurchase agreement, which was entered into in the third
quarter of 2018.

For the third quarter of 2018, net interest income and other financing income
(taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $956 million million, up $35 million
compared to the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin (taxable-
equivalent basis) was 3.50 percent for the third quarter of 2018 and 3.36
percent in the third quarter of 2017. Both net interest income and other
financing income and net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) benefited
from higher market interest rates and average loan balances in 2018. These
increases were partially offset by additional wholesale funding, which
included expense associated with $1.5 billion of debt issued in the third
quarter of 2018.

The provision for loan losses totaled $84 million in the third quarter of 2018
compared to $76 million during the third quarter of 2017. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis
for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $82 million, or an annualized 0.40 percent of average
loans, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $76 million, or an annualized
0.38 percent for the third quarter of 2017. See Note 4 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2018, was 1.03 percent of total
loans, net of unearned income, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2017.
Total non-performing loans decreased to 0.66 percent of total loans, net of
unearned income, at September 30, 2018, compared to 0.81 percent at December
31, 2017.

Non-interest income from continuing operations was $519 million for the third
quarter of 2018 compared to $482 million for the third quarter of 2017. The
increase was primarily driven by growth in capital markets income, card and
ATM fees and other non-interest income. See Table 20 "Non-Interest Income from
Continuing Operations" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense from continuing operations was $922 million in the
third quarter of 2018, a $69 million increase from the third quarter of 2017.
The increase was primarily driven by a $60 million contribution to the Regions
Financial Corporation Foundation during the third quarter of 2018. Higher
salaries and benefits expense and professional, legal and regulatory costs
also contributed to the increase year over year. See Table 21 "Non-Interest
Expense from Continuing Operations" for more detail.

Income tax expense from continuing operations for the three months ended

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $486 million from year-end
2017 to September 30, 2018, due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit
with the FRB, as the result of normal day-to-day operating variations.

Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of
agency mortgage-backed securities. See Note 3 "Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. See the
"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity Risk" sections for more
information.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $331 million at September 30, 2018, consisting of
$297 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $19 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $15 million of non-performing loans.
At December 31, 2017, loans held for sale totaled $348 million, consisting of
$325 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $6 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $17 million of non-performing loans.
The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for
sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate
depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2017 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note
4 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional discussion.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $1.9 billion since year-end 2017 driven
primarily by new relationships and expansion of existing relationships within
the Company's corporate and middle market portfolios aided by growth within
specialized lending groups, which offset the impact of large corporate
customers utilizing the fixed income market to pay down and pay off bank debt.
Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations.
These loans declined $250 million from year-end 2017, reflecting a slowing
pace of decline. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are
made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $209 million in comparison to 2017 year-
end balances. Due to the nature of the cash flows typically used to repay
investor real estate loans, these loans are particularly vulnerable to weak
economic conditions.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans experienced a $159 million increase in comparison to 2017 year-end
balances. This increase was partially offset by the sale of $254 million of
primarily performing troubled debt restructured loans and certain non-
restructured interest-only loans during the first quarter of 2018.
Approximately $2.1 billion in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the first nine months of 2018.

Home Equity

Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This
type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their
homes. The home equity portfolio totaled $9.4 billion at September 30, 2018 as
compared to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Substantially all of this
portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of
September 30, 2018. The balances presented are based on maturity date for
lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that
convert to a repayment period.

Of the $9.4 billion home equity portfolio at September 30, 2018, approximately
$6.0 billion were home equity lines of credit and $3.4 billion were closed-end
home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Beginning in
December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and
a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have
an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009
to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a
10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a
20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw
period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means
there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for
interest-only lines of credit.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios, taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio
segment. Current LTV data for the remaining loans in the portfolio is not
available, primarily because some

of the loans are serviced by others. Data may also not be available due to
mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the
entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance
exceeds the current estimated collateral, the entire balance is included in
the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to
partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $180 million from year-end 2017,
primarily because Regions terminated a third-party purchase arrangement during
the fourth quarter of 2016. The balance is expected to continue to decrease.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale lending through
third parties. This portfolio class increased $712 million from year-end 2017,
primarily due to continued growth in existing point of sale initiatives.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $17 million from
year-end 2017.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans.

Regions qualitatively considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators
for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. The
following tables present estimated current FICO score data for components of
classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current FICO data is not available
for the remaining loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if
customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available.
Residential first mortgage and home equity balances with FICO scores below 620
were 5 percent of the combined portfolios for both September 30, 2018 and
December 31, 2017.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.
Discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance is included in
Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for
Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as related
discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis.

The allowance for loan losses totaled $840 million at September 30, 2018 as
compared to $934 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses
as a percentage of net loans decreased from 1.17 percent at December 31, 2017
to 1.03 percent at September 30, 2018. The decrease in percentage is
attributable to reductions in non-performing, criticized and TDR loans, as
well as total delinquencies.

The provision for loan losses decreased by $60 million for the first nine
months of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. Net charge-offs for the
first nine months of 2018 were approximately $16 million lower as compared to
the same period in 2017. During the first nine months of 2018, the provision
for loan losses was less than net charge-offs by approximately $94 million, as
a result of broad-based improvements in credit metrics. Additionally, lower
than anticipated losses associated with certain 2017 hurricanes resulted in
the release of the Company's $40 million hurricane-specific loan loss
allowance during 2018. Lastly, a $16 million net reduction to the provision
for loan losses from the first quarter of 2018 sale of $254 million in
residential first mortgage loans consisting primarily of performing troubled
debt restructured loans also contributed to the results.

In October 2018, a significant hurricane impacted Regions' footprint,
primarily in the state of Florida, particularly the Panhandle area, as well as
southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Regions is assessing all aspects of
the impact to its customers, and in some situations, customers are still
evaluating the extent of damage. While Regions is still evaluating the aspects
of the hurricane, the overall financial impact to the Company is not expected
to be material.

Management expects that net loan charge-offs will be in the 0.35 percent to
0.50 percent range for the 2018 year; based on recent trends and current
market conditions, Regions currently expects to be toward the lower end of
that range. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility
in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future levels of
net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during
the remainder of 2018. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to
individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 7 "Allowance
for Credit Losses."

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity,
consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under
the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the
result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were
offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and
investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in
interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below
market. More detailed information is included in Note 4 "Loans and the
Allowance For Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The
following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing
and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

Note: All loans listed in the table above are considered impaired under
applicable accounting literature.

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR inflows in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to inflows from
CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types
of concessions currently being granted under the CAP, as detailed in Note 4
"Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and
loans transferred to held for sale. It also includes $30 million of commercial
loans and $5 million of investor real estate loans refinanced or restructured
as new loans and removed from TDR classification for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, $59
million of commercial loans and $10 million of investor real estate loans were
refinanced or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification.

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA

the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans
excluded were $83 million at September 30, 2018 and $124 million at December
31, 2017.  
  
Non-performing loans at September 30, 2018 have decreased compared to year-end
levels, due to continued broad-based improvement in credit quality. Total
commercial and investor real estate non-performing loans, excluding loans held
for sale, that were paying as agreed (e.g., less than 30 days past due)
represented approximately 60 percent of the total balance at September 30,
2018.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, excluding government
guaranteed loans, were $137 million at September 30, 2018, a decrease from
$167 million at December 31, 2017.

At September 30, 2018, Regions had approximately $75 million to $135 million
of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not
included in non-accrual loans, but for which management had concerns as to the
ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms.
This is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate
loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next
quarter.

In order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans, credit
personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be
downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending on the occurrence of
future events. These personnel consider a variety of factors, including the
borrower's capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms,
make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary,
and provide current and complete financial information including global cash
flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. Based upon the
consideration of these factors, a probability weighting is assigned to loans
to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans
during this specific time period. Additionally, for other loans (for example,
smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the
estimate of potential future downgrades. Because of the inherent uncertainty
in forecasting future events, the estimate of potential problem loans
ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as
opposed to an individual listing of loans.

The majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is
based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for
substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are
included in Note 4 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements.

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans
held for sale) by portfolio segment:

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and $4.9 billion at
December 31, 2017 and is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments
(each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on
an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair
value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer
to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the 2017
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further discussion of when Regions
tests goodwill for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation
approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit).
The decline in the goodwill balance in the third quarter of 2018 is due to the
sale of Regions Insurance Group. See Note 2 "Discontinued Operations" for
related disclosure.

The result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of 2018 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions' reporting units for
the September 30, 2018 interim period.

OTHER EARNING ASSETS

Other earning assets totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2018, consisting
primarily of $880 million of FRB and FHLB stock, $393 million of operating
lease assets, and $475 million marketable equity securities. At December 31,
2017, other earning assets totaled $1.9 billion, consisting primarily of $684
million of FRB and FHLB stock, $489 million of operating lease assets, and
$414 million of marketable equity securities.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions
also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking
services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet
banking.

Total deposits at September 30, 2018 decreased approximately $3.6 billion
compared to year-end 2017 levels, driven by decreases in interest-bearing
transaction accounts, money market accounts, non-interest-bearing demand
accounts and time deposits, partially offset by an increase in savings
accounts. Interest-bearing transaction accounts have declined primarily due to
the Company's continued strategic reduction of certain trust customer
deposits, which require collateralization by securities, and have been shifted
into other fee income-producing customer investments. Money market accounts
have continued to decline as a result of a decision to reduce higher-cost
brokered deposits that were no longer a necessary component of the Company's
funding strategy. The non-interest-bearing demand decline is due primarily to
customers using liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses.
Customer time deposits declined as a result of the Company's strong liquidity
profile providing less need for higher-cost deposits as part of its funding
strategy.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, totaled $3.3 billion at
September 30, 2018 as compared to $500 million at December 31, 2017. The
levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding
needs and the sources utilized.

In the near term, Regions expects the use of wholesale unsecured borrowings
for its funding needs to remain low. Short-term secured borrowings, such as
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core
portion of Regions' funding strategy.

The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances
continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity
Risk" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings increased by approximately $3.0 billion in the first nine
months of 2018 due primarily to increases in FHLB advances and senior notes
issuances. These increases were partially offset by maturities and a
redemption of notes during the period.

In the first nine months of 2018, Regions issued $500 million of senior notes,
and simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap effectively converting
the notes to floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR. Regions also had $100
million of senior notes mature during the first nine months of 2018.

In the first nine months of 2018, Regions Bank issued $1.9 billion of senior
notes. These senior notes included an issuance of $550 million of 2.75% senior
notes, which were effectively converted to floating rate notes at 1 month
LIBOR through the simultaneous execution of an interest rate swap. Regions
Bank also redeemed $750 million of senior notes and had $500 million of
subordinated notes mature during the first nine months of 2018.

Long-term FHLB advances have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.3 percent
at September 30, 2018 and 1.4 percent at December 31, 2017 with remaining
maturities ranging from less than one year to twelve years and a weighted-
average of 0.7 years.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stockholders' equity was $14.8 billion at September 30, 2018 as compared to
$16.2 billion at December 31, 2017. During the first nine months of 2018, net
income increased stockholders' equity by $1.4 billion, while cash dividends on
common stock reduced stockholders' equity by $349 million and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced stockholder's equity by $48 million. Changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders' equity by $645
million, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on
securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of
increases in market interest rates during 2018. Common stock repurchased
during the first nine months of 2018 reduced stockholders' equity by $1.8
billion. These shares were immediately retired and therefore are not included
in treasury stock.

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.

See Note 7 "Stockholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CAPITAL RULES

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank and, as such, began transitioning to the Basel III Rules in January 2015
subject to a phase-in period extending to January 2019. When fully phased in,
the Basel III Rules will increase capital requirements through higher minimum
capital levels as well as through increases in risk-weights for certain
exposures. Additionally, the Basel III Rules place greater emphasis on common
equity. The Basel III Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a measure
called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional
Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1
narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital
measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv)
expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior
regulations.

Additionally, the Basel III Rules introduce a new capital conservation buffer
designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital
conservation buffer is on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The Basel
III Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weightings of assets
and off-balance sheet exposures to derive the capital ratios.

In September 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed to revise and
simplify the capital treatment for selected categories of deferred tax assets,
MSRs, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority
interests for banking organizations, such as Regions and Regions Bank, that
are not subject to the advanced approach. In November 2017, the federal
banking agencies revised the Basel III Rules to extend the current
transitional treatment of these items for standardized approach banking
organizations until the September 2017 proposal is finalized. The September
2017 proposal would also change the capital treatment of high volatility
commercial real estate loans under the standardized approach. These changes
would have the impact of increasing regulatory capital ratios for some
standardized approach banking organizations such as Regions. Regions continues
to review the proposal and its impact on the Company's capital requirements.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as
the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the
standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these
standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk
(including by recalibrating risk-weights and introducing new capital
requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as
unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach
for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will
generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor
phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules,
operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to
advanced approach institutions, and not to Regions or Regions Bank. The impact
of Basel IV on the Company will depend on the manner in which it is
implemented by the federal banking regulators.

  

On April 10, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to simplify
capital rules for large banks. The proposal introduces a "stress capital
buffer," which would replace the existing capital conservation buffer and
incorporate forward-looking stress test results into non-stress capital
requirements. The proposed stress capital buffer is defined as the greater of
the sum of a bank's degradation in its CET1 capital ratio in CCAR, excluding
any planned capital actions, and four quarters of planned common stock
dividends or a floor of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.

  

On May 14, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal that would
amend regulatory capital rules to provide banks with the option to phase in
the day-one effects on regulatory capital that may result from adoption of the
new current expected credit losses accounting standard (see Note 15 "Recent
Accounting Pronouncements"). Additionally, the agencies are proposing

  

77

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

amendments to stress testing regulations which would delay incorporation of
the new accounting standard in stress testing until the 2020 stress test
cycle.

  

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
("EGRRCPA") was enacted on May 24, 2018, which provides certain limited
amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other modifications to certain
post-crisis regulatory requirements. The EGRRCPA raises the asset threshold
for the Systemically Important Financial Institution designation from $50
billion to $250 billion and eliminates the company-run stress tests for
institutions with less than $250 billion in assets. The EGRRCPA will likely
decrease the overall regulatory burden on institutions like Regions; however,
the ultimate impact is uncertain at this time and will depend on the
implementation of the law by the federal banking agencies. On July 6, 2018,
the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement regarding the
impact of the EGRRCPA. The statement provides information on rules and
associated reporting requirements that EGRRCPA affected such as company-run
stress testing, resolution plans, Volcker Rule, HVCRE exposures, and other
provisions. Among other things, the statement permits banks to use current
information to estimate and report HVCRE acquisition, development and
construction loans as defined in the EGRRCPA. Regions implemented this change
effective June 30, 2018, and it did not have a material impact.

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules and their applicability to
Regions is included in Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and
Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as related discussion
in Management's Discussion and Analysis.

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank
regulatory requirements:

The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and
Leverage capital ratios are estimated.  
  
The reductions in the capital ratios of Regions since December 31, 2017 are
primarily the result of share repurchases, including the contractual
repurchase agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2018. See Note 7
"Stockholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to
the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO

The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC approved a final rule in 2014
implementing a minimum LCR requirement for certain large BHCs, savings and
loan holding companies and depository institutions, and a less stringent LCR
requirement (the "modified LCR") for other banking organizations, such as
Regions, with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule
imposes a monthly calculation requirement. As of January 1, 2017, the LCR
calculation rule has been fully phased in. In December 2016, the Federal
Reserve issued a final rule on the public disclosure of the LCR calculation
that requires BHCs, such as Regions, to disclose publicly, on a quarterly
basis, quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of
its LCR for quarterly periods ending after October 1, 2018.

At September 30, 2018, the Company was fully compliant with the LCR
requirements. Changes in the mix and size of the Company's balance sheet and
investment portfolio are likely to occur in the future, and additional funding
may need to be sourced to remain compliant.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017 for more information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average total loans," "adjusted efficiency ratio,"
"adjusted fee income ratio," "return on average tangible common stockholders'
equity," on a consolidated and continuing operations basis, and end of period
"tangible common stockholders' equity," and "Basel III CET1, on a fully
phased-in basis" and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings
and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items
provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management
believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the
Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures
are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions' business
because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments
to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of
these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the
performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.
Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

Presentations to investors of Company performance  
  
Total average loans is presented excluding the impact of the first quarter
2018 residential first mortgage loan sale and the indirect vehicles third-
party exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP).
Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a meaning calculation
of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by
management.

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these

  

79

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and
non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a
taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total
revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for
the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common stockholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common stockholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common stockholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

The Basel Committee's Basel III framework will strengthen international
capital and liquidity regulations. When fully phased-in, Basel III will
increase capital requirements through higher minimum capital levels as well as
through increases in risk-weights for certain exposures. Additionally, the
Basel III Rules place greater emphasis on common equity. The Federal Reserve
released its final Basel III Rules detailing the U.S. implementation of Basel
III in 2013. Regions, as a standardized approach bank, began transitioning to
the Basel III framework in January 2015 subject to a phase-in period extending
through January 2019. Because the Basel III implementation regulations will
not be fully phased-in until 2019 and, are not formally defined by GAAP, these
measures are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and
banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy using the fully
phased-in Basel III framework, Regions believes that it is useful to provide
investors information enabling them to assess Regions' capital adequacy on the
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans to
adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of net income
(GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders (GAAP) to net
income available to common shareholders from continuing operations (GAAP) 4) a
reconciliation of non-interest expense from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest expense from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 5) a
reconciliation of non-interest income from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 6) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), 9) a reconciliation of average and ending
stockholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
stockholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP),
10) a reconciliation of stockholders' equity (GAAP) to Basel III CET1, on a
fully phased-in basis (non-GAAP), and 11) calculation of the related ratio
based on Regions' current understanding of the Basel III requirements (non-
GAAP).

(1) Adjustments to average loan balances assume a simple day-weighted average
impact for the first nine months of 2018, and are equal to the ending balance
of the residential first mortgage loans sold for the prior periods.

|  
---|---  
  
(2)

|

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold affordable housing residential
mortgage loans to Freddie Mac. Approximately $91 million were sold with
recourse, resulting in a deferred gain of $5 million, which was recognized
during the second quarter of 2017.  
  
(3) Income statement amounts have been annualized in calculation.

(4) Due to the immaterial impact of the discontinued operations, the balance
sheet has not been presented on a continuing operations basis.

(5) Current quarter amounts and the resulting ratio are estimated.

|  
---|---  
  
(6)

|

Regions continues to develop systems and internal controls to precisely
calculate risk-weighted assets as required by Basel III on a fully phased-in
basis. The amounts included above are a reasonable approximation, based on
current understanding of the requirements.

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income and other financing

September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, adjusted for applicable state
income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.  
  
  

For the third quarter of 2018, net interest income and other financing income
(taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $956 million compared to $921 million in
the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis)
was 3.50 percent for the third quarter of 2018 and 3.36 percent for the third
quarter of 2017. Net interest income and other financing income (taxable-
equivalent basis) totaled $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion for the first nine
months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net interest margin (taxable-
equivalent basis) was 3.48 percent and 3.31 percent for the first nine months
of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net interest margin (taxable-
equivalent basis) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018,
compared to the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to higher market
interest rates and higher average loan balances partially offset by wholesale
funding costs.

Based on recent performance and market conditions, the Company updated its
expectations in the third quarter of 2018. Management now expects to increase
adjusted net interest income and other financing income (non-GAAP and non-
taxable equivalent) in the range of 5 to 6 percent on a full year basis in
2018.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income and other financing income in various interest rate scenarios compared
to a base case scenario. Net interest income and other financing income
sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of
Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income and other financing
income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate
cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions
are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of
the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that
results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the
assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the
pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the
characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly
considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts,
prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well
as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income and other financing income
throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate
sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest
rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using "market
forward rates." The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the
traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis
points. While not presented, up-rate scenarios of greater magnitude are also
analyzed. Larger magnitude down-rate scenarios continue to be of limited use
in the current rate environment. Therefore, Regions presents a minus 100 basis
point rate shock as its largest meaningful falling rate scenario. In addition
to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios
are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate
movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic
the speed of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of September 30, 2018, Regions was
asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts
as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending September
2019. The estimated exposure associated with the parallel yield curve shift of
minus 100 basis points in the table below reflects the combined impacts of
movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-
term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on
Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets
and liabilities contractually tied to such rates. Recent Fed Funds increases
have not resulted in a meaningful increase in deposit costs for Regions.
Therefore, it is expected that declines in deposit costs will only partially
offset the decline in asset yields. A reduction in intermediate and long-term
interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and
mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly
originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment
portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing
securities in the investment portfolio. At current rate levels, the interest
income sensitivity afforded by potential further extension of investment
securities and the resulting impact on premium amortization is reduced, making
intermediate and long-term interest rate sensitivity primarily attributable to
changes in the level of reinvestment yields on fixed rate assets.

With respect to sensitivity along the yield curve, the balance sheet is
estimated to be asset sensitive to short-term, intermediate-term, and long-
term rates individually. Current simulation models estimate that, as compared
to the base case, net interest income and other financing income over a 12
month horizon would respond favorably by approximately $77 million if
intermediate and longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a
sustained basis exceed the base scenario by 100 basis points. Conversely, if
intermediate and longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a
sustained basis underperform the base case by 100 basis points, then net
interest income and other financing income, as compared to the base case,
would decline by approximately $97 million.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting
hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start
within the measurement horizon.

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table
18 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the course
of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions that affect the estimates for net interest income and other
financing income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall
balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties
associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates, management
evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions.
Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be
predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet growth assumptions include moderate loan
and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of
deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by
analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on
management's expectations in the current rate environment. In the +200 basis
point gradual interest rate change scenario in Table 18, the total cumulative
interest bearing deposit re-pricing sensitivity is expected to be
approximately 60 percent of changes in short-term market rates (e.g., Fed
Funds), as compared to approximately 55 percent in the 2004 to 2007 historical
timeframe. Recently observed market rate movements have yielded higher levels
of asset sensitivity than modeled due primarily to outperformance in deposit
betas as compared to the model assumption. A 5 percentage point lower
sensitivity than the 60 percent baseline would increase 12 month net interest
income and other financing income in the gradual +200 basis points scenario by
approximately $60 million. While the estimates should be used as a guide,
differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market
and competitive factors.

Similarly, management assumes that the change in the mix of deposits in a
rising rate environment versus the baseline balance sheet growth assumptions
is informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in
rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-
bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent, but
equates to approximately $3.5 billion over 12 months in the gradual +200 basis
point scenario in Table 18. In the event this shift increased by an additional
$3.0 billion over 12 months, the result would be a reduction of 12 month net
interest income and other financing income in the gradual +200 basis points
scenario by approximately $32 million.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
stockholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a
predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts

are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position and available for sale securities portfolios to a variable-rate
position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company executed certain transactions
affecting the total notional amount of its derivatives designated for interest
rate hedging. In particular, these transactions increased the total notional
amount within interest rate swaps for cash flow hedging derivatives by
approximately $1.0 billion.

A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated above in Table 19
are forward starting, and therefore do not impact, or have limited impact to
the estimated annual change in net interest income discussed in Table 18.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All interest rate swap derivatives traded
by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 contains more
information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note
10 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-
end derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative and balance sheet transactions to economically mitigate the impact
of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative
instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the
current risk profile of Regions' current portfolio.

MARKET RISK--PREPAYMENT RISK

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment
speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments.
Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net
interest income and other financing income. For example, mortgage loans and
other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may
refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets
prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in
lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce
Regions' interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising
rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in
opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates.
Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value
of equity. Regions' greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in
its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan
portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to
interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment
risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates,
but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or
indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and
financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either
encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is
extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors.
The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable
expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided.
Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest
income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSR. Regions
actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest
income and other financing income forecasting and interest rate risk
management.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. The liquidity coverage ratio rule is designed
to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary assets on hand to
withstand short-term liquidity disruptions. See the "Liquidity Coverage Ratio"
discussion included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential
litigation contingencies. See Note 13 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, borrowed funds and stockholders' equity. Regions' goal in liquidity
management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs.
Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company's funding
requirements is important.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions
performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at
the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy
requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater
of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash
balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company
totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2018. Compliance with the holding
company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a
quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank
and subsidiaries. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not
currently include any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits
are established within the Company's Liquidity Risk Oversight Committee and
ALCO, which regularly reviews compliance with the established limits.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 3 "Debt
Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various
secured borrowing capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds.
Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one-to-four
family residential first mortgage loans. Regions' liquidity is further
enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can
also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although
Regions does not currently rely on short-term unsecured wholesale market
funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At September 30, 2018,
Regions had approximately $1.6 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, a
decrease from approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of September 30, 2018, based
on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $18.5 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of September 30, 2018, Regions'
outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was $9.0 billion and its total
borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled $17.5 billion. FHLB borrowing
capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB.
Regions Bank pledged certain securities, commercial and real estate mortgage
loans, residential first mortgage loans on one-to-

four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the
FHLB advances outstanding. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required
in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 8 "Other
Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2017 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The FHLB has been and is
expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Regions
may also issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank note
program or as stand-alone issuances. Refer to Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings"
to the consolidated financial statements in the 2017 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has a diversified loan portfolio in terms of product
type, collateral and geography. See Table 2 for further details of each loan
portfolio segment. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of
risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security
risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks
that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, the increasing use
of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to conduct more
financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication and
activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists
and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify
and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its
information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and
vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems
and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls
are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and
transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing
practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure
its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the
resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue
to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to protect its
systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a
strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes
oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.

The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Regions' continuous efforts
to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience. The Board monitors
Regions' information management risk policies and practices primarily through
its Risk Committee, which oversees areas of operational risk such as
information technology activities; risks associated with development,
infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and oversight of information
security risk assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster
recovery, business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the
Board's Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions' cybersecurity practices,
mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared
by the Chief Information Security Officer, risk management, and Internal
Audit. The Board, through its various committees, is briefed at least
quarterly on information security matters.

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to
gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions
to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is
a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services
sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third
party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability
and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so
information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to
other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC,
Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its
members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and
fraud topics.

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation.
These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions
in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant
resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these
measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure,
Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading
consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also
developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans
that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the
effects of any such event. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to data
breaches may be offset by applicable insurance.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks on to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business.

Table of Contents

  

  

The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new
customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions
also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business
infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the
information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them
may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan
losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb
probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The
provision for loan losses totaled $84 million in the third quarter of 2018
compared to $76 million during the third quarter of 2017. The provision for
loan losses totaled $134 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to
$194 million for the first nine months of 2017. Refer to the "Allowance for
Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further
detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund fees and other service charges. The increases
during the third quarter of 2018 and the first nine months of 2018 compared to
the same periods of 2017 were primarily due to continued customer account
growth and increases in non-sufficient fund activity.

Card and ATM fees--Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit
card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. The increases in
the third quarter of 2018 and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same
periods of 2017 were primarily the result of an increase in commercial and
consumer checkcard interchange income associated with new account growth and
increases in transactions.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that includes securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger
and acquisition and other advisory fees. The increases in the third quarter of
2018 and the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017
were primarily due to increases in income from mergers and acquisitions
advisory fees, customer interest rate swap income, loan syndication fees, and
fees generated from securities underwriting and placement.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance decreased in the first
nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to
reduced claims benefits.

Investment services fee income--Investment services fee income represents
income earned through investment advisory services, the primary revenue
streams of which include sales of annuity and brokerage products. Investment
services fee income increased during the third quarter of 2018 and the first
nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 primarily due to
improved productivity as a result of hiring additional financial advisors.

Securities gains, net--Net securities gains primarily result from the
Company's asset/liability management process, as well as the sale of certain
securities held for employee benefit purposes in 2017.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. These adjustments are
offset in salaries and benefits expense.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees, and other
miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual
gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments,
cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges.
Other miscellaneous income increased in the third quarter of 2018 and the
first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 primarily due
to increases in the value of equity investments, net gains associated with the
sale of certain low income housing tax credit investments, and leveraged lease
termination gains. Also contributing to the increases for both the quarter and
year-to-date periods were decreases in net impairment charges related to
certain operating lease assets.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits include
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.
The primary drivers of the increases were higher severance charges, annual
merit increases and higher production-based incentive expenses, partially
offset by staffing reductions. Severance charges totaled $54 million and $7
million for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Full-time
equivalent headcount from continuing operations decreased to 19,869 at
September 30, 2018 from 21,391 at September 30, 2017, reflecting the impact of
the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic
priorities.

Net occupancy expense--Net occupancy expense includes rent, depreciation and
amortization, utilities, maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other expenses of
premises occupied by Regions and its affiliates. Net occupancy expense
decreased in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 compared to
the same periods of 2017 primarily due to hurricane-related branch damage,
hurricane preparedness and other storm-related charges incurred in the third
quarter of 2017. Also contributing to the decreases were declines in rent
expense and depreciation.

Outside services--Outside services consists of expenses related to routine
services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs,
data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data
subscriptions, and check printing. Outside services increased during the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017
primarily

due to increased servicing costs related to point-of-sale lending through
third parties and additional expenses recorded related to a new Wealth
Management platform.

FDIC insurance assessments--FDIC insurance assessments decreased in the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017
as a result of higher net income, sale of troubled debt restructured loans
during the first quarter of 2018, and issuances of unsecured senior bank notes
during the first and third quarters of 2018.

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses--Professional, legal and
regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other
professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory
expenses increased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018
compared to the same periods in 2017 due to higher consulting fees related to
implementation of strategic priorities and litigation-related costs.

Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses--Provision (credit) for unfunded
credit losses is the adjustment to the reserve for unfunded credit
commitments, which can fluctuate based on the amount of outstanding
commitments and the level of risk associated with those commitments. A
provision for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to increased
commitments, while a (credit) for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to
reduced levels of estimated risk for commitments.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses and mortgage repurchase costs. Other
miscellaneous expenses increased during the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 primarily due to the
contribution to Regions' charitable foundation, offset by decreased valuation
charges associated with other real estate and lower non-service cost related
pension and other postretirement benefits expense resulting from a settlement
charge recorded in the second quarter of 2017.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense from continuing operations for the three
months ended September 30, 2018 was $85 million and $138 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2017, resulting in effective taxes rates of 18.7
percent and 30.8 percent, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $302 million
compared to income tax expense of $398 million for the same period in 2017,
resulting in effective tax rates of 20.7 percent and 30.2 percent,
respectively. The effective tax rate is lower in both current periods due to
Tax Reform enacted in December 2017 that reduced the federal statutory rate
from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The Company expects
the full-year effective tax rate will be approximately 21 percent for 2018.

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the
level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions
with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing
investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible
expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may
occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such
as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments,
valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits.
Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may
be impacted.

At September 30, 2018, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $231
million compared to a net deferred tax asset of $163 million at December 31,
2017. The increase in the net deferred tax asset was primarily due to an
increase in the deferred tax asset related to the unrealized losses on
available for sale securities and derivative instruments, and was partially
offset by an increase in the deferred tax liability related to employee
benefits and a decrease in the deferred tax asset related to state net
operating losses and federal tax credits.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. Morgan Keegan was sold
on April 2, 2012.

Regions' results from discontinued operations are presented in Note 2
"Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements. The three
and nine months ended September 30, 2018 income from discontinued operations
included the gain associated with the transaction of $281 million ($196
million after tax).

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Regions'
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. During the quarter ended
September 30, 2018, there have been no changes in Regions' internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial
reporting.

These shares represent the initial shares received under the terms of a
contractual repurchase agreement and reflect approximately 80 percent of the
total shares to be repurchased upon final settlement of the transaction.  The
final number of shares repurchased is based on the volume-weighted average
stock price of the Company's common stock during the term of the transaction,
less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the contractual repurchase agreement. On October 24, 2018, the
transaction was settled and the Company received an additional 8.8 million
shares at no additional cost, which have not been reflected in the table
above. The average price paid per share represents the actual price paid per
share based upon final settlement of the contractual repurchase agreement,
inclusive of the discount. The full price paid per the contractual repurchase
agreement of $700 million has been deducted from the "Maximum Approximate
Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under Publicly Announced
Plans or Programs" column.

The total average price paid per share was determined, consist with the
discussion in footnote (1), by including the 8.8 million additional shares
received on October 24, 2018 at no additional cost.  
  
  

Regions' Board authorized a new $2.031 billion common stock repurchase plan,
permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2018 through
the end of the second quarter of 2019. As of September 30, 2018, Regions has
repurchased approximately 59.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost
of $1.3 billion under this plan, which includes the 29.1 million shares
initially received and full price paid of $700 million under the contractual
repurchase agreement. The counterparty to the contractual repurchase agreement
closed the transaction on October 24, 2018, and the Company subsequently
received 8.8 million shares, at no additional cost. The Company also continued
to repurchase shares on the open market under its capital plan in the fourth
quarter of 2018. As of November 6, 2018, Regions had repurchased approximately
25.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $274.5
million. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and,
therefore, will not be included in treasury stock.

Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchase of Stock

Holders of Regions common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as
Regions' Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.
Furthermore, holders of Regions common stock are subject to the prior dividend
rights of the holders of Regions preferred stock then outstanding.

Regions understands the importance of returning capital to shareholders.
Management will continue to execute the capital planning process, including
evaluation of the amount of the common dividend, with the Board and in
conjunction with the regulatory supervisors, subject to the Company's results
of operations. Also, Regions is a BHC, and its ability to declare and pay
dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including
the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and
dividends.

On November 1, 2012, Regions completed the sale of 20 million depositary
shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of its 6.375%
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share
("Series A Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share).
The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit Regions from declaring or
paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock, including its
common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock,
unless Regions has declared and paid full dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. The Series A

Preferred Stock is redeemable at Regions' option in whole or in part, from
time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2017, or
in whole, but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory
capital treatment event (as defined in the certificate of designations
establishing the Series A Preferred Stock).

On April 29, 2014, Regions completed the sale of 20 million depositary shares,
each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of its 6.375% Fixed-
to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value
$1.00 per share ("Series B Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary
share). The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock prohibit Regions from
declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock,
including its common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such
junior stock, unless Regions has declared and paid full dividends on the
Series B Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. The
Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at Regions' option in whole or in part,
from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after September 15,
2024, or in whole but not in part, at any time following a regulatory capital
treatment event (as defined in the certificate of designations establishing
the Series B Preferred Stock).
