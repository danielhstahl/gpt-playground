Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions
may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the
actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in
those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that
are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including
the scope and duration of the pandemic (including any resurgences), actions
taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and their
success, the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines, and the direct and
indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather
are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and
information available to, management at the time the statements are made.
Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various
risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to
inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such
statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but
are not limited to, those described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and
severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the global
economy, has and could continue to adversely affect our capital and liquidity
position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and
increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result
in lost revenue or additional expenses. The pandemic could also result in
goodwill impairment charges and the impairment of other financial and
nonfinancial assets, and increase our cost of capital.

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law,
which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return
capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our
allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater
financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory
standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective
customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing
products and services to meet customers' needs and respond to emerging
technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our
revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those
related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could
result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including
legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as
changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by
applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of
the recent change in U.S. presidential administration and control of the U.S.
Congress, which could require us to change certain business practices,
increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us,
or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases,
or redemptions of preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments,
must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with
applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements
and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our
ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements
(as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a
significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of
such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements
(including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including
our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable
terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market
perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any
litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our
subsidiaries.

•The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative
effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative,
or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other
legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which
may adversely affect our results.

•Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity
to support our businesses.

•Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our
ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to
our strategic initiatives.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of
businesses, including our recently completed acquisition of EnerBank and risks
related to such acquisition, including that the expected synergies, cost
savings and other financial or other benefits may not be realized within the
expected timeframes, or might be less than projected; difficulties in
integrating the business; and the inability of Regions to effectively cross-
sell products to EnerBank's customers; as well as our pending acquisition of
Sabal and risks related to such acquisition, including delays in closing the
transaction; that the expected synergies, cost savings, and other financial or
other benefits of the transaction might not be realized within the expected
timeframes, or might be less than projected; and difficulties in integrating
Sabal's business.

•The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.

•Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to
assist in the development, management and operation of our products and
services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from
time to time.

•Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.

•Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or
counterparties.

•Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses,
such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and
other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach
of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act
or failure to deliver our services effectively.

•Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies
for our businesses on acceptable terms.

•The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or
mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

•The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil
unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or
indirectly, on our businesses.

•The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods,
droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the
Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or
our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity
and impact of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts,
floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be
exacerbated by global climate change.

•Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the
cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by
changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by
commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or
manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could
impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce
demand for loans in those industries.

•Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data
security breaches, malware, ransomware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking"
and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could
disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or
damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our
reputation.

•Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based
financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative
products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other
negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.

•The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit
rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic
conditions that we are not able to predict.

•The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that
adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to
change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs
on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure
provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the
disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary
information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause
losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions
Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB
or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements
and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses
relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove
incorrect.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the
SEC.

•Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock
repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments
related to any of the items identified above.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to
predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either
as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as
may be required by law.

"Risk Factors" section of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter

Debt securities with carrying values of $9.4 billion and $10.3 billion at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, were pledged to
secure public funds, trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements.
Included within total pledged securities is approximately $24 million of
encumbered U.S. Treasury securities at both September 30, 2021, and December
31, 2020.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at September 30, 2021, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 129 at December 31, 2020, to 337 at September 30,
2021. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2020 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss represented credit impairment as of those dates.
The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of
their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale were immaterial for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. As part of the Company's normal process for
evaluating impairment, management did not identify any positions where
impairment was believed to exist in either of the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 or 2020.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, Regions purchased
approximately $986 million and $1.3 billion in indirect-other consumer,
residential first mortgage and commercial and industrial loans from third
parties, respectively.

At September 30, 2021, $16.2 billion in securities and net eligible loans held
by Regions were pledged for potential borrowings from the FHLB. At September
30, 2021, an additional $12.8 billion in net eligible loans held by Regions
were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

Table of Contents

  

Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance are sales-type and
direct financing leases totaling $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2021, with
related income of $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, for a description of the methodology.

As of September 30, 2021, Regions' total loans included $1.5 billion of PPP
loans. These loans are guaranteed by the Federal government and as the
guarantee is not separable from the loans, Regions recorded an immaterial
allowance on these loans.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Regions decreased the
allowance by $794 million to $1.5 billion, which represents management's best
estimate of expected losses over the life of the portfolio. The decrease was
due primarily to continued improvement in the economic outlook and strong
credit trends. While the allowance estimate reflects these benefits, elevated
levels of imprecision remain due to continued uncertainty regarding the timing
of full economic recovery.

Macroeconomic factors utilized in the CECL loss models include, but are not
limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, HPI and the S&P 500 index, with
unemployment being the most significant macroeconomic factor. Regions' models
are sensitive to changes in the economic scenarios. The September 30, 2021
economic forecast was relatively consistent with the June 2021 forecast with
the exception of the HPI and S&P 500 index which had increases during the
quarter. Risks to the economic forecast and the model limitations are
considered through model adjustments and the qualitative framework.

The following tables present analyses of the allowance by portfolio segment
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

Regions' portfolio segments are commercial, investor real estate and consumer.
Classes within each segment present unique credit risks. Refer to Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for information regarding Regions' portfolio segments
and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit
quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories
related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions
assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship
utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time
management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to
fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in this review process. Regions' ratings are aligned to federal
banking regulators' definitions and are utilized to develop the associated
allowance. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for information regarding
commercial risk ratings.

Regions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique
credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices
and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio.
FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal
underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company
quarterly for all consumer loans, including

residential first mortgage loans. Current FICO data is not available for
certain loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers
do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. These
categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.
The higher the FICO score the less probability of default and vice versa.

The following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, by vintage year
as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Classes in the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes
in the consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer
to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information regarding Regions'
credit quality indicators.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding the Company's
TDRs, including their impact on the allowance and designation of TDRs in
periods subsequent to the modification.

As provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed into law on December
27, 2020, which extended initial guidance provided in the CARES Act, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act relief and short-term nature of most
COVID-19 deferrals precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan
modifications from being classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Carrying value, end of period| $| 410 | | | $| 267 | | | $| 410 | | | $| 267 |  
________

(1)"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology
is a discounted net cash flow approach.

  

In the nine months ended 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased the rights to
service residential mortgage loans on a flow basis for approximately $58
million and $35 million, respectively.

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the
valuation's sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs
(excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| September 30  
| 2021| | 2020  
| (Dollars in millions)  
Unpaid principal balance| $| 36,370 | | | $| 33,740 |  
Weighted-average CPR (%)| 10.3 | %| | 16.3 | %  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (30)| | | $| (22)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (53)| | | $| (40)|  
Option-adjusted spread (basis points)| 530| | 621 |  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase| $| (9)| | | $| (6)|  
Estimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase| $| (18)| | | $| (12)|  
Weighted-average coupon interest rate| 3.6 | %| | 4.0 | %  
Weighted-average remaining maturity (months)| 294| | 283  
Weighted-average servicing fee (basis points)| 27.3 | | | 27.4 |  
  
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans:

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 11 for additional information.

Regions periodically evaluates the commercial MSRs for impairment based on
fair value. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs was approximately
$96 million at September 30, 2021 and $81 million December 31, 2020.

(1)Dividends on all series of preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are
payable quarterly in arrears.

(2)The shares were fully redeemed on June 15, 2021.

(3)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR
plus 3.536%.

(4)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to August 15, 2029, 5.700%, and (ii) for
each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029, three-month LIBOR plus
3.148%.

(5)Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2025, 5.750%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2025, the five-year
treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date plus
5.426%.

All series of preferred stock have no stated maturity and redemption is solely
at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part,
after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, at any time
following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B, Series C,
Series D, and Series E preferred stock.

Regions completed the issuance of Series E preferred stock during the second
quarter of 2021, The Company incurred $10 million of issuance costs associated
with the transaction. The Company began paying quarterly dividends on
September 15, 2021. The Series A preferred stock was redeemed in the second
quarter of 2021.

The Board declared a total of $62 million and $69 million in cash dividends on
Series A, Series B, and Series C preferred stock during the first nine months
of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Board declared $15 million in cash
dividends on Series D preferred stock during the first nine months of 2021;
the initial quarterly dividend for Series D was declared in the third quarter
of 2020 for $6 million. The initial quarterly dividend of $7 million for the
Series E preferred stock was declared in the third quarter of 2021. Therefore,
a total of $84 million in cash dividends on total preferred stock was declared
in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the total of $75 million in cash
dividends on total preferred stock for the same period in 2020.

In the event Series B, Series C, Series D or Series E preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $67 million, $10 million, $4 million, or
$10 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to common shareholders'
equity. The remaining amounts listed represent issuance costs that were
recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will
be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

Regions was not required to participate in the 2021 CCAR; the Company chose to
participate in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB.
Regions received the results of the voluntary test on June 28, 2021. The
Federal Reserve communicated that the Company exceeded all minimum capital
levels under the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Stress Test. Effective October
1, 2021, Regions' preliminary SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2021
through the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
In the second quarter of 2021, Regions repurchased approximately 8.0 million
shares of common stock under this plan which reduced shareholders' equity by
$167 million. Included in these share repurchases were approximately 1.0
million shares that were repurchased as part of the amendment to the Company's
deferred investment plan for its directors. All of these shares were
immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore, were not be included in
treasury stock. The Company did not repurchase shares in either the first or
third quarters of 2021 or throughout 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the second quarter of 2021, but was
lifted in the third quarter of 2021. The Board approved a common stock
increase to $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2021. Prior to the common
stock increase, Regions declared $0.155 per share in dividends for both the
first six months of 2021 and the first nine months of 2020. Therefore, Regions
declared a total of $0.48 per common share for the first nine months of 2021
compared to a total of $0.465 per common share for the first nine months of
2020.

2021 includes $13 million of issuance costs associated with the redemption of
Series A preferred shares in the second quarter of 2021.

The effects from the assumed exercise of 4 million in restricted stock units
and awards and performance stock units for both the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2021 was not included in the above computations of
diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an
antidilutive effect on earnings per common share. The effects from the assumed
exercise of 9 million and 8 million in stock options, restricted stock united
and awards and performance stock units for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, respectively, were not included in the above computations
of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an
antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

(1)Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives
in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

(2)Includes accrued interest of $12 million at September 30, 2021 and $28
million at December 31, 2020, respectively.

(3)Includes accrued interest of $9 million at September 30, 2021 and $12
million at December 31, 2020, respectively.

(4)Estimated fair value includes premium of approximately $41 million as of
September 30, 2021 and $83 million as of December 31, 2020 to be amortized
over the remaining life. Approximately $32 million of the decrease since
December 31, 2020 related to hedges that were terminated during the first nine
months of 2021 and were not amortized into earnings as of the date of
termination.

(5)Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements, and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

(6)The gain amounts, which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or
reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other
derivative positions. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
financial instruments posted of $24 million, for both periods, were not offset
in the consolidated balance sheets.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors. As of September 30, 2021, Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions through 2025.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company terminated $2.3
billion in notional of floor hedges. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021, the Company terminated $5.0 billion and $10.6 billion,
respectively, in notional of cash flow swap hedges. The following table
presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges on AOCI. The
balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI will be amortized into earnings
through 2026.

Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $341 million in pre-
tax income due to the receipt or payment of interest payments and floor
premium amortization on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months.
Included in this amount is $259 million in pre-tax net gains related to the
amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to-market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Regions had $695 million and $924
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, Regions had $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in total
notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-
to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward
sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in
mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock
commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial
mortgage loans are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss)

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2022 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2021 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of September 30, 2021 was approximately $476 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at September 30, 2021
and 2020 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit
protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap
transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were $109 million and $74 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $108 million and $74
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis:

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for residential mortgage
servicing rights, which are the only material assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
mortgage loans and certain commercial loans originated with the intent to
sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the changes in fair
values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge
them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge
accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other loans held
for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative
instruments. Fair values of residential first mortgage loans held for sale are
based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or
discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization
activities that include servicing values and market conditions, and are
recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also elected to measure certain commercial loans held for sale at
fair value, as these loans are actively traded in the secondary market. The
Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for substantially all of these
loans through a third party valuation service that is broadly used by market
participants. While most of the loans are traded in the market, the volume and
level of trading activity is subject to variability and the loans are not
exchange-traded. The balance of commercial loans held for sale was immaterial
at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential first mortgage
loans held for sale measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. These
changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An
immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-
specific credit risk.

NOTE 10. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised. Accordingly, the prior period was updated to reflect
these enhancements. In the first quarter of 2021, the net interest income
allocation methodology was enhanced. All net interest income including the FTP
offset, activities of the treasury function, securities portfolio and interest
rate risk activities is allocated to the three reporting segments.

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the period indicated.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters
of credit. Refer to Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more
information regarding these instruments.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| September 30, 2021| | December 31, 2020  
| (In millions)  
Unused commitments to extend credit| $| 60,653 | | | $| 56,644 |  
Standby letters of credit| 1,783 | | | 1,742 |  
Commercial letters of credit| 52 | | | 132 |  
Liabilities associated with standby letters of credit| 31 | | | 25 |  
Assets associated with standby letters of credit| 32 | | | 25 |  
Reserve for unfunded credit commitments| 71 | | | 126 |  
  
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
September 30, 2021, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether

48

Table of Contents

  

discovery has begun or is not complete; whether meaningful settlement
discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class
allegations. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more
complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially
in the early stages of the proceeding when it is not known whether a class
will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As
a result, Regions may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with
respect to some of the matters disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated
amount discussed above may not include an estimate for every matter disclosed
below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. As previously disclosed,
Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the CFPB into certain of
Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional inquiries will arise
from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries
could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or
enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material
effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments,
findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third for the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $4.8 billion and
$4.5 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability
related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5
billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company
would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for
Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default
and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without
value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $5 million at both September 30, 2021 and December
31, 2020. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for
additional information.

the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At September 30, 2021, Regions operated 1,310 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment
Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

On February 27, 2020, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement
to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company
headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and
included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses.
Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail.

On June 8, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire EnerBank USA, a
consumer lending institution specializing in home improvement lending
headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The transaction closed on October 1,
2021, and resulted in the addition of approximately $3.1 billion in loans to
consumers.

On October 4, 2021, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital
Partners, LLC, a diversified financial services firm that facilitates lending
in the small-balance commercial real estate market headquartered in Irvine,
California. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2021, subject to regulatory approval.

THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. The October 2021 baseline forecast anticipates
real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2021, 4.6 percent in 2022, and 2.9 percent
in 2023. While the downside risks posed by the COVID-19 virus have not been
eliminated, they nonetheless have diminished with further progress on the
vaccination front, but global supply chain and logistics bottlenecks remain a
constraint on growth. Ample liquidity in the household and corporate sectors
along with accommodative monetary and fiscal policy will be supportive of
growth. That said, Regions expects that by mid-2023 the economy will be back
on the path of growth around 2.0 percent that prevailed prior to the pandemic.
As has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, there remains a
heightened degree of uncertainty around economic forecasts being made at
present.

The dominant theme in the economic data over recent months is the growing
imbalance between the supply side of the economy and the demand side. Due to
an unprecedented degree of fiscal and monetary policy support, greater numbers
of people being vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, and further easing of
restrictions on economic activity, the demand side of the economy is notably
robust. The supply side of the economy, however, is simply unable to keep
pace. Shortages of labor and non-labor inputs and shipping bottlenecks have
driven up costs to producers and acted as drags on output growth. Moreover,
the extent to which they have been drawn down over recent months means
inventories are no longer providing a meaningful buffer between demand and
supply. The growing imbalance between demand and supply has contributed to the
sharp acceleration in inflation over recent months.

Supply/demand imbalances remain evident in the labor market data. As of
September, the level of nonfarm employment was 4.97 million jobs below the
pre-pandemic peak, while there are over three million fewer people in the
labor force than was the case prior to the pandemic. Yet, there are over ten
million open jobs waiting to be filled, and it seems clear that firms would be
hiring more workers if they were available. While it had been expected that
labor supply constraints would begin easing in the fall months, there is
little evidence thus far showing that to be the case. The supply/demand
imbalance in the labor market is leading to more upward pressure on wages than
would seem consistent with the remaining degree of labor market slack, with
average hourly earnings rising across all broad industry groups. It should be
noted, however, that with the various rounds of pandemic-related transfer
payments having largely run their course, labor earnings have resumed their
role as the main driver of growth in personal income.

The acceleration in the growth of labor income comes at a time when the
personal saving rate remains significantly elevated, with an estimated $2.3
trillion more in household saving than would have been the case had pre-
pandemic income and saving trends been maintained. Moreover, after having
fallen by $6.26 trillion (annualized) in the second quarter of 2020, household
net worth has since risen by $31.09 trillion, reflecting higher house prices
and higher equity prices. Households have also been paring down non-mortgage
debt, and household debt burdens continue to hover near record-lows. As such,
conditions are in place for continued growth in consumer spending over coming
quarters. Residential investment is expected to be a support for real GDP
growth over coming quarters, but to a lesser degree than had previously been
the case. Despite mortgage interest rates remaining favorable, notably lean
inventories have fueled rapid house price appreciation over the past year,
thus eroding affordability. Though still notably rapid, the pace of house
price appreciation has begun to moderate, and further moderation is expected
through the forecast horizon.

As measured by the CPI, inflation has been at or above 5.0 percent in each
month since May 2021, which is expected to remain the case into early-2022.
While factors such as base effects and normalization effects that boosted
inflation in the summer months have faded from the data, supply chain
bottlenecks, higher shipping costs, and higher labor costs remain as sources
of more persistent inflation pressures. As such, while inflation is expected
to slow from current rates, it is likely to remain above the FOMC's 2.0
percent target rate through 2022. That said, the FOMC continues to believe
that inflation pressures are mostly transitory which, along with their stated
willingness to let inflation run above their target rate for "some time,"
makes it unlikely they will respond to higher inflation in the near term.
While it is expected that the FOMC will begin tapering the pace of the Fed's
monthly asset purchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, no changes in the Fed
funds rate target range are expected until either late-2022 or early-2023. As
such, monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative over the forecast
horizon.

The October baseline forecast incorporates the infrastructure bill which has
garnered bipartisan support in Congress, which would result in roughly $579
billion in spending above what has previously been assumed. While there is
scope for further fiscal policy measures, at present there are no specific
details on either the spending side or the tax side of the ledger and, as
such, no such changes are incorporated into the current baseline forecast. It
should also be noted that expectations of the potential economic effects of
the infrastructure bill and any additional spending should be tempered by the
fact that any such spending would be phased in over an eight-to-ten year
period and would be at least partially offset by tax increases. As such, the
net effect on GDP growth in any given year over the forecast horizon would be
relatively small.

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected be
broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. While an above-average
exposure to manufacturing across much of the footprint will be a tailwind to
growth within the footprint, supply chain and logistics bottlenecks mean that
growth will be slower than would otherwise be the case. To the extent remote
working remains part of the post-pandemic landscape, states such as Florida,
Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Texas that have consistently benefited
from above-average degrees of in-migration should continue to do so, which
will provide support to the broader economies of these states.

The continued signs of economic improvement, with consideration of uncertainty
inherent in the forecast, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating
the ACL as of September 30, 2021. See the "Allowance" section for further
information.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the
economic environment in which the Company operates. In the third quarter of
2021, the economic forecast continued to show signs of recovery. While some
uncertainty remains, the economic forecast shows a much more positive outlook
as the economy is more fully open. There are select areas where the COVID-19
pandemic impacted third quarter conditions, as discussed below. Regions
expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and
the Company's financial results in future quarters, albeit at a diminishing
rate.

While most non-branch associates continued to work remotely during the third
quarter of 2021, Regions began the process of returning remote working
associates to office locations in October 2021.

As of September 30, 2021, the outstanding balance of special COVID-related
payment deferrals and forbearances, which were not government guaranteed, had
declined to an immaterial amount.

As a certified SBA lender, Regions provided its customers with the loan
process under the PPP. Program funding ended in the second quarter of 2021 and
the forgiveness process is ongoing. Regions originated PPP loans totaling
approximately $6.2 billion, of which approximately 26,000 loans totaling
approximately $1.5 billion remained outstanding as of September 30, 2021.
Regions expects that approximately 80% to 85% of the total $6.2 billion of PPP
loans will be forgiven by year-end 2021.

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the
Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has
ample sources of liquidity that include a stable deposit base, cash balances
held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank,
unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the
Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders'
Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. Due to changes in
customer behavior, combined with continued enhancements to overdraft practices
and transaction postings, the Company estimates consumer service charges will
remain 10 percent to 15 percent below pre-pandemic levels. See Table 24 "Non-
Interest Income" for more detail.

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail.

Capital

During the third quarter of 2020, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement
for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0
percent. In the second quarter of 2021, Regions received the results of the
Company's voluntary participation in 2021 CCAR. The FRB communicated that the
Company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test
and the Company's stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of 2021 through
the third quarter of 2022 will be floored at 2.5 percent.

As part of the Company's capital plan, on April 21, 2021, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting
purchases from the second quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022.
For the third quarter of 2021, Regions temporarily paused the repurchase of
shares until the close of the EnerBank acquisition which was completed on
October 1, 2021.

On October 20, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend for the fourth
quarter of 2021 of $0.17 per share of common stock, which was in compliance
with the FRB's SCB framework.

The Company intends to operate at a range for CET1 of 9.25 percent to 9.75
percent, with the expectation to manage to the mid-point by year-end 2021. The
Company regularly performs internal stress testing which can result in
modifications to the operating range.

Third Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $624 million,
or $0.65 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $501
million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020.

For the third quarter of 2021, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $976 million, down $24 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 2.76 percent for the
third quarter of 2021 and 3.13 percent in the third quarter of 2020. The
decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in average
loan balances and re-mixing into lower yielding lending portfolios. Net
interest margin was negatively impacted by excess cash balances due to
continued deposit growth as well as the repricing of fixed-rate loan and
securities portfolios at lower market interest rates. Refer to Table 20
"Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis" for further
details.

The benefit from credit losses totaled $155 million in the third quarter of
2021, as compared to a provision of $113 million during the third quarter of
2020. The current quarter benefit was primarily due to positive credit
performance and continued improvement in the economic forecast. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $30 million, or an annualized 0.14 percent of average
loans, in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $113 million, or an
annualized 0.50 percent for the third quarter of 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

The allowance was 1.80 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at
September 30, 2021 compared to 2.69 percent at December 31, 2020. The decrease
was impacted by the factors discussed above. The allowance was 283 percent of
total non-performing loans at September 30, 2021 compared to 308 percent at
December 31, 2020. Total non-performing loans (excluding loans held for sale)
declined to 0.64 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at September
30, 2021 compared to 0.87 percent at December 31, 2020. Refer to the
"Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $649 million for the third quarter of 2021, a $6
million decrease from the third quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily
driven by a decline in mortgage income and a gain on an equity investment that
was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. These decreases were largely
offset by increased capital markets income and other miscellaneous income. See
Table 24 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $938 million in the third quarter of 2021, a
$42 million increase from the third quarter of 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits expense and a loss
on early extinguishment of debt incurred in the quarter. See Table 25 "Non-
Interest Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was $180
million compared to $104 million for the same period in 2020. See "Income
Taxes" toward the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of
this report for more detail.

Table of Contents

  

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $9.6 billion from year-end
2020 to September 30, 2021, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit
with the FRB. Elevated cash from deposit growth is held at the FRB. Deposit
growth was primarily driven by pandemic-related deposit inflows resulting in
higher consumer account balances and new account growth during the first nine
months of 2021. See the "Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more
information.

DEBT SECURITIES

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including
both available for sale and held to maturity:

| $| 29,931 | | | $| 28,276 | | | |  
  
Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Debt securities increased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2020 to September 30,
2021. The increase from year-end was primarily the result of the purchase of
approximately $2.0 billion in U.S treasury securities, mortgage-backed
securities and corporate and other debt securities during the second quarter
of 2021.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $934 million at September 30, 2021, consisting of
$850 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $81 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $3 million of non-performing loans.
At December 31, 2020, loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion, consisting of
$1.4 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $460 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $6 million of non-performing loans.
The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for
sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations fluctuate depending
on the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2020 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to
Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding Regions'
portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each.

While the economic environment continues to improve as the economy re-opens,
there are select industries that continue to experience impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See Table 3 and Table 4 below for more detail.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans decreased $1.1 billion since year-end 2020. The September
30, 2021 balance includes $1.5 billion of PPP loans, a decrease of $2.1
billion compared to year-end 2020, reflecting PPP forgiveness. While line
utilization levels remain well below pre-pandemic levels, utilization levels
slightly increased by the end of the third quarter compared to the inflection
point reached in the second quarter. Excluding PPP lending balances,
commercial loan balances increased since year-end 2020 driven by growth in
healthcare, transportation, technology and defense, as well as equipment
lending through Ascentium.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations.
Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to
commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

products that are real estate related.

(2)"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.

(3)As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.

Regions has identified certain industry sectors within the commercial and
investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to
COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in all three quarters of 2021,
which narrowed the high-risk industry sectors compared to year-end 2020. As of
September 30, 2021, these high-risk industries include energy, consumer
services and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Identified COVID-19
high-risk balances have declined $2.7 billion from $5.2 billion at year-end
2020 to $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2021.

Industries and sub-sectors identified as high-risk may change in future
periods depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over
time. These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within
these industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. Regions is closely monitoring
customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers.
All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless
specifically identified as IRE. PPP loan balances are not included in Table 4
as these loans are not considered high risk, as they are fully guaranteed by
the U.S. government.

(1)Amounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.

(2)Regions defines classified loans as commercial and investor real estate
loans risk-rated substandard accrual and non-accrual, and criticized loans as
those risk-rated special mention, substandard accrual and non-accrual.
Criticized loans are also referred to as "criticized and classified".

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $49 million in comparison to 2020 year-
end balances.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $772 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances.
The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an
increase in originations due to continued historically low market interest
rates. Approximately $4.8 billion in new loan originations were retained on
the balance sheet through the first nine months of 2021.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $664 million in comparison to 2020 year-end
balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions'
branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home
equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment
upon maturity or a 5-year draw

period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means
there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for
interest-only lines of credit.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of
September 30, 2021. The balances presented are based on maturity date for
lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that
convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans
decreased by $157 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which was lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio decreased $434 million from year-end 2020 as
Regions has discontinued its indirect auto lending business. The Company
remains in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through
third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio decreased $308
million from year-end 2020 due to exiting a third party relationship during
the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $77 million from
year-end 2020.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $48 million from year-
end 2020.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" .

ALLOWANCE

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and
the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Discussion of the methodology
used to calculate the allowance is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2020, as well as related discussion in Management's
Discussion and Analysis.

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to
external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by
changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate
demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health
pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural
disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

The allowance totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021 compared to $2.3
billion at December 31, 2020, which represents management's best estimate of
expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios.
Key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 7 below.
While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the
category most relevant.

_______

(1)This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-
off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans. This line
item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $1.5 billion as of September 30,
2021, which are fully backed by the U.S. government and have an immaterial
associated allowance.

(2)This balance includes $64 million related to the initial allowance for non-
PCD loans acquired as part of the Ascentium acquisition. Impact included only
for the quarter of acquisition.

(3)Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and
recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a
reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets in the
first quarter of 2020.

  

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions'
internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The third quarter of
2021 exhibited continued strong asset quality performance, reflecting broad-
based improvements across most portfolios. Commercial and investor real estate
criticized balances decreased approximately $168 million, classified balances
decreased $107 million, and total net

charge-offs decreased $17 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. Non-
performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets decreased
approximately $136 million and $234 million, respectively, compared to the
second quarter of 2021. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well and
while the HPI remained strong in the third quarter of 2021, the pace of house
price appreciation has begun to moderate and further moderation is expected
through the forecast horizon.

Regions continued to perform a bottom-up review of loan portfolios during the
third quarter of 2021, which resulted in no change to the sectors considered
high-risk compared to the second quarter of 2021; however the balance of loans
in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments declined approximately $200 million
from June 30, 2021. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more
information about the high-risk industries. As the credit risk within Regions'
loan portfolio continues to be evaluated, both negative and positive factors
of the economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance
estimate.

As economic activity continued to accelerate due to the largely reopened
economy, the third quarter of 2021 showed continued signs of economic
improvement. Regions' September 2021 forecast was relatively consistent with
the June 2021 forecast with continued increases in HPI and some caution around
GDP growth. Regions' economic forecast utilized in the September 30, 2021
allowance estimate considered sustained reopening of the economy, further
vaccine distribution and continued increases in consumer spending on goods and
services. Refer to the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets within
the "Third Quarter Overview" section for more information. Furthermore,
Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external
data available.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of September 30, 2021. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment rates in the third quarter and the forecasted periods
remained normalized.

| 4,805  
  
The continued improvement in the economic outlook and positive credit
performance during the quarter (described above) were significant drivers of
the modeled decreases in the allowance.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The September 30, 2021 general imprecision
allowance was reduced compared to the second quarter of 2021, but continues to
reflect management's caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the
allowance given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery,
including the potential for higher inflation, as the changing status of the
pandemic unfolds.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$1.5 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of September 30, 2021.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates,
unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, inflation and collateral
valuations as well as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy
accommodations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result
in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2021 and
beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. As provided initially in the CARES Act
passed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently extended through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020, certain
loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020
through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1,
2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this
provision of both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required
guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the
disclosures below.

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other
consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and
investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal
program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a
workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real
estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate
is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market.
Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information
is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan
balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the
periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(2)Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the
FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but
not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed
loans excluded were $44 million at September 30, 2021 and $57 million at
December 31, 2020.

Non-performing loans at September 30, 2021 have decreased compared to year-end
levels, driven by improvement in retail, energy and administrative, support
and waste repair.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020
and is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting
unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or
more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the
reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial
statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for
impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to
determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit).

The result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of 2021 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for any of Regions' reporting units for
the September 30, 2021 interim period.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service
and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers.
Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality
banking services and the Company's digital channels and contact center.

The following table summarizes deposits by category:

Corporate treasury time deposits| -- | | | 11 | | |  
| | | | |  
| $| 132,039 | | | $| 122,479 | | |  
  
Total deposits at September 30, 2021 increased approximately $9.6 billion
compared to year-end 2020 levels, driven by increases in all categories other
than customer time deposits. Increases across those categories were primarily
driven by pandemic-related deposit inflows resulting in increased consumer
customer deposit balances and new account growth. To a lesser degree, growth
in non-interest bearing demand is due to an increase in deposits from business
customers who continue to retain excess liquidity. Customer time deposits
decreased due to maturities, and continued lower interest rates resulted in a
decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts.

Long-term borrowings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion since year-end
2020 due primarily to redemptions of parent and bank debt. See the "Liquidity"
section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB, which
is currently not being utilized.

On January 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the
redemption on January 22, 2021, of its 3.20% senior notes due February 2021
pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of
100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On February 19, 2021, Regions Bank sent notices of redemption, which resulted
in the redemption on March 1, 2021 of its 2.75% senior bank notes due April 1,
2021 and of its senior floating rate bank notes due April 1, 2021 pursuant to
their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On August 12, 2021, Regions issued $650 million of 1.80% senior notes due
August 2028 which were effectively converted to floating rate notes at 1 month
LIBOR through the simultaneous execution of an interest rate swap. Also on
August 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the
redemption on August 23, 2021, of its 3.80% senior notes due August 2023
pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In conjunction with the
redemption, Regions incurred related early extinguishment pre-tax charges
totaling $20 million.

At September 30, 2021, one Ascentium note securitization class remained
outstanding with an interest rate of 2.12% maturing in October 2025. At
December 31, 2020, the Ascentium note securitizations had various classes and
had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.12% with remaining maturities
ranging from 3 years to 5 years and a weighted-average of 4.3 years.

SHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $18.6 billion at September 30, 2021 as compared to
$18.1 billion at December 31, 2020. During the first nine months of 2021, net
income increased shareholders' equity by $2.1 billion, cash dividends on
common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $460 million, and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $84 million. Changes in
AOCI decreased shareholders' equity by $783 million, primarily due to the net
change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and
derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during
the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The derivative instruments are
hedges designed to protect net interest income in a low short-term interest
rate environment, such as the one that currently exists. During the second
quarter of 2021, the Company issued Series E preferred stock, which increased
shareholders' equity by $390 million. During the second quarter of 2021, the
Company also redeemed all of the outstanding shares of it's Series A preferred
stock, which decreased shareholders' equity by $500 million. Common stock
repurchased during the first nine months of 2021 reduced shareholders' equity
$167 million. These shares were immediately retired and therefore are not
included in treasury stock.

Total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $18 million, representing the
unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which
Regions held the majority interest at September 30, 2021.

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to
Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking
agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is
included in the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business"
section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory
Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2020
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13
"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated
financial statements in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At
September 30, 2021, the impact of the add-back on CET1 was approximately $390
million, or approximately 36 basis points.

(1)The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,
and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

  

In October of 2020, the SCB framework that was finalized in the first quarter
of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk
sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help
determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5
percent to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result
of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital
Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5 percent in addition to the minimum
risk-weighted asset ratios shown above.

During the third quarter of 2020, and in connection with the results of its
supervisory stress test released in June 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized
Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third
quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the
amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario,
inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. In the second
quarter of 2021, Regions received the results of the Company's voluntary
participation in 2021 CCAR. The FRB communicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test and the Company's
stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter
of 2022 is floored at 2.5 percent.

The Company intends to operate at a range for CET1 of 9.25 percent to 9.75
percent, with the expectation to manage to the mid-point by year-end 2021. The
Company regularly performs internal stress testing which can result in
modifications to the operating range.

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential
standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters
related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under
these rules.

  

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and
report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity Management Policy and
the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within
the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity
risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk
limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the
framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are
further tailored to be commensurate with Regions' operating model and risk
profile.

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the "Supervision
and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section,
the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2020 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

N/A - Not applicable.

  

On July 13, 2021, Fitch upgraded Regions' outlook from Stable to Positive
citing improved credit quality and returns relative to peers.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more
information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall
classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average balances of loans", "adjusted ending
balances of loans", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted net
interest margin", "adjusted efficiency ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio",
"return on average tangible common shareholders' equity" on a consolidated
operations basis, and end of period "tangible common shareholders' equity",
and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain
other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a
meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes
will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and
predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used
by management to assess the performance of Regions' business because
management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be
indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these
non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of
the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and
the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation

Average total loans and ending total loans are presented including commercial
loans reclassified from held for sale and excluding loan balances related to
loans originated through the SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer
exit portfolio and the indirect-vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted
average total loans (non-GAAP) and adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP).
Regions believes adjusting average and ending total loans provides a
meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same
basis as that applied by management.

Table of Contents

  

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to
loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss
allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government, are excluded from total loans and the related credit loss is
excluded from the total allowance for credit losses.

Net interest margin is presented excluding the impact of SBA PPP loans and
excess cash, defined as cash exceeding $750 million. Regions believes the
adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) provides investors with meaningful
additional information about Regions' performance when margin associated with
the SBA's PPP loans and excess cash are excluded from net interest margin
(GAAP).

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are
added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted
efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common shareholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common shareholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common shareholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans
(GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of
ending total loans (GAAP) to adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), a
reconciliation of ACL (GAAP) to ACL excluding PPP loans' ACL (non-GAAP), and a
computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 4) a
reconciliation of net interest margin (GAAP) to adjusted net interest margin
(non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available
to common shareholders (GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest expense
(GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of net
interest income, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest
income, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of non-
interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 10) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 11) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), and 12) a reconciliation of average and ending
shareholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

(1)The impact of SBA PPP loans was determined using average PPP loan balances
of $2.1 billion and $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2021, respectively, and $4.6 billion and $2.6 billion for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Related SBA PPP net
interest income totaled $31 million and $113 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and $31 million and $49 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

(2)The impact of excess cash was determined using the average cash balance in
excess of $750 million, which approximates the average cash balance for the
four quarters preceding the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic, and related net
interest income. Excess cash totaled $24.4 billion and $20.9 billion for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and $9.6 billion
and $5.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020,
respectively. The related net interest income totaled $3 million and $8
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,
and $1 million and $2 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2020, respectively.

Net interest income decreased for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same
period in 2020 and slightly increased for the first nine months of 2021
compared to the same period in 2020. The net interest income decline in the
third quarter was due to lower long-term rates, but was partially offset by
lower deposit and borrowing costs, active cash management strategies, and an
outsized credit interest recovery during the quarter. Interest income on loans
for the first three and nine months of 2021 and 2020 was aided by the
Company's hedging strategy, with benefits expanding as more notional became
active throughout 2020. The hedges had a positive impact of approximately $314
million for the first nine months of 2021 compared to $163 million in the same
period of 2020.

Net interest margin declined for both the third quarter and first nine months
of 2021, compared to the same periods in 2020, primarily driven by continued
elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances. Regions continues to
prudently manage its excess liquidity balances through extinguishments of
long-term borrowings and securities purchases. Net interest margin for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods of
2020 was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed-rate loan portfolios
and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates. Excluding the
impact of PPP lending and excess cash, which Regions considers to be balances
in excess of $750 million, adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) for the
third quarter 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to
the same periods in 2020 declined modestly to 3.30% and 3.34%, respectively.
See Table 19 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of
adjusted net interest margin.

Exclusive of the impact from PPP loans, excess cash, an outsized credit
recovery experienced in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter EnerBank and
Sabal acquisitions, net interest income is expected to be stable in the fourth
quarter; aided by hedging, balance sheet management strategies, and deposit
rates.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all
rates fall to levels consistent with historical minimums. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of September 30, 2021, Regions was
asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts
as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending
September 2022.

The third quarter of 2021 continued the trend of growth in low-cost deposits
and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. Retention of these balance
sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and much of the recent deposit growth may
be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario. Therefore, additional
sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-related "surge" deposit pricing
behavior and retention is outlined in Table 21.

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios
in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term
and long-term interest rates. Currently, net interest income sensitivity to
short-term rates is approximately neutral when excluding pandemic-related
deposit increases; however, it will increase in 2023 and beyond as receive
fixed interest rate swap hedges begin to mature. An increase or reduction in
short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on
Excess Reserves and 1-month LIBOR) will drive the yield on assets and
liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. Under either
environment, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet
hedging income will completely offset the change in asset yields until those
hedges mature. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge" deposits with
lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for further
net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario as well.

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors. While
this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it also
represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve
steepens. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as
intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will
drive yields higher on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans,
increase prospective yields on certain investment

portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing
securities in the investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment
where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall. Approximately 70% of
fixed rate asset production is at the 5-year tenor point or shorter.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 21 is informed
by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the
balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of
instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many
assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best
estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the
behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is
uncertain. Therefore, Table 21 includes two balance sheet scenarios to help
inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an opportunity scenario,
and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable, legacy balances,
which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second is a reduction
scenario assuming that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate,
requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the
bank. For this scenario, "surge" deposits are assumed to encompass all balance
growth on legacy accounts evidenced from February 2020 to September 2021, or
approximately $27 billion. These deposits, including non-interest bearing
products, are attributed with a 75% repricing beta in rising rate scenarios.
Importantly, the impact to net interest income under a changing rate
environment is the same whether the "surge" deposit balances are held at a
higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale
sources. Given the evolving nature of the environment, estimates have been
conservatively derived. Should the balances remain with the Company longer or
demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates, there is potential for upside
(e.g. the opportunity scenario). The disclosure in Table 21 does not prescribe
a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet.

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels
is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case
scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 21, interest-bearing deposit
rates remain in the single digits. The deposit beta model is dynamic across
both interest rate level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100
basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate 20% to
25% interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the "surge"
deposit interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario, assuming
legacy betas and a 75% beta, respectively. Deposit pricing outperformance or
underperformance of 5% in that scenario would increase or decrease net
interest income by approximately $30 million, respectively.

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy
deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior
rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from
non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of
the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12
months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 21.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in
various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors).
The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More
information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 22 and its accompanying
description. Importantly, outstanding receive-fixed cash flow hedges begin to
mature in December 2022. While those maturities are outside of the 12-month
horizon of the analysis outlined in Table 21, the hedge maturity profile will
begin to add asset sensitivity at a time when markets currently expect the
FOMC to begin to increase short-term interest rates. The EnerBank acquisition,
which closed October 1, 2021, is excluded from the analysis outlined in Table
21. EnerBank is initially estimated to have little impact on Regions' interest
rate risk position. Over time, as its fixed-rate, brokered time deposit
funding matures and fixed-rate loan balances grow, EnerBank is expected to
assist Regions in being modestly less asset sensitive. The combined impacts
from hedge maturities and the EnerBank acquisition will add rising rate
exposure (i.e. increase sensitivity) to the interest rate shocks in Table 21
in 2023 and beyond.

(1)Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward
looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases
and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing. While not included in
the table, hedge maturities partially offset by EnerBank impacts are expected
to add rising rate exposure by 2023.

(2)All cash flow hedges are fully reflected within the measurement horizon
(See Table 23 for additional information regarding hedge maturity dates).

(3)Scenario assumes all deposits (including "surge" deposits) perform
consistently with historical experiences.

(4)Scenario accounts for uncertainty in "surge" deposit balances. Assumes a
75% beta on "surge" balances, calculated as legacy deposit growth experienced
since February 2020 ($27 billion as of September 2021).

(5)The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a rate shock where all
rates are floored at historical lows observed during the pandemic.

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a
consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market
forward rates, equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate
equal to the historical all-time minimum. Further, the scenarios presented do
not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 21 above
quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under
this environment.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps
are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for
variable rate (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional
principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest
settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to
purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time.
Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market
instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign
currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a
specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf
of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another
party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives
to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its
mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the
origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the
potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect
the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in
interest rates and pricing.

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest

_________

(1)Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination
of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1-month LIBOR.

  

As of September 30, 2021, all of the cash flow hedging relationships
designated in Table 22 above were active. Total cash flow hedges have a
current weighted average maturity of approximately 2.3 years. During the third
quarter, Regions shortened a portion of its future hedge exposure to balance
its future interest rate risk needs with the evolving macro-economic
environment and its changing balance sheet. Swap notionals of $5 billion with
a weighted-average life of 4.4 years were re-structured to mature in December
2022. Year-to-date, total notional of $11.3 billion has been replaced with
shorter maturity swaps. In addition, longer maturity receive fixed swap
termination trades of $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 were intended
to offset some of the sensitivity impact from adding $2.0 billion fixed-rate
securities during the second quarter.

Importantly, the gain on unwound hedges is deferred and amortized into net
interest income over the life of the original hedge, creating no change in the
expected net interest income profile relative to the discounted future cash
flows under market forward rates at the time the hedges are unwound. These
changes and the resulting hedge maturity profile allow for an increasing asset
sensitive balance sheet position when the FOMC seems more likely to move
short-term rates higher. Further, the industry transition away from LIBOR
rates is not expected to materially impact either hedge effectiveness or
income recognition on the Company's current portfolio of hedges.

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts outstanding at
each year-end period. The initial hedge maturities begin in December 2022.

_________

(1)All cash flow hedges active within the 12-month measurement horizon are
included in the income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 21.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives
traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to

83

* * *

Table of Contents

  

benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective
clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in Regions' Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains more information on the
management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of
these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of
Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty
credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 8 "Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements
for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-end derivatives positions and
further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR TRANSITION

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use
after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or
2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31, 2021.
Existing contracts referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated
no later than June 30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by
the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative
products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use
LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in
settings other than 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a
LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with
all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this
program, the Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks
associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks
associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions' Executive LIBOR
Steering Committee. Regions is following industry efforts to develop
alternative reference rates and is operationally ready to offer new benchmarks
as they are adopted by regulatory agencies and industry groups.

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of
customers, which include:

•The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide
for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial
products.

•The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as
adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US
regulators, ARRC, and GSEs.

•The discontinuation of LIBOR-based commercial lending after mid-September.
The Company has already made preparations to provide multiple alternative
rates based on market competition and demand. Regions has participated in,
evaluated, or made preparations to lend with a number of other indexes,
including SOFR, BSBY, and AMERIBOR.

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in
its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and
models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented
processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate
communications with customers regarding the transition.

As of September 30, 2021, Regions had approximately $33.7 billion of total
outstanding commercial and investor real estate loans and approximately $1
billion of total consumer loans that reference LIBOR. Regions also has
securities within its investment portfolio of $368 million that reference
LIBOR. Furthermore, Regions' Series B and C preferred stock reference LIBOR
when their dividend rate begins to float after 2023 and had total carrying
values of $433 million and $490 million, respectively, as of September 30,
2021.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for
affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 for details.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
sustains Regions' ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers.
Regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain liquidity sources and
reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions
maintains a variety of liquidity sources, as further described below.
Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures,

84

* * *

Table of Contents

  

including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain
appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity
base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans,
and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in
the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by
Regions' relatively steady deposit base.

The securities portfolio serves as a primary source and storehouse of
liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of
securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see
Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements).
Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the portfolio (for example, the
agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash
through various secured borrowing arrangements. Cash reserves, liquid assets
and secured borrowing capabilities (including borrowing capacity at the FHLB,
as discussed below) aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed
conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations
related to potential litigation. (See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.) Liquidity needs can also be met by
borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits
on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such
markets.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At September 30, 2021,
Regions had approximately $25.8 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an
increase from approximately $16.4 billion at December 31, 2020, which has
continued to be impacted by deposits associated with government programs
offered in relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents"
section for more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of September 30, 2021, based
on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $12.8 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of September 30, 2021, Regions
had no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $16.2 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledges certain
securities and loans as collateral, which comprise its FHLB borrowing
capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required based on
membership and in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB
has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of
funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 5
"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash
sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other
cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021.
Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk
Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO
regularly review compliance with the established limits.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber
attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, which have
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by
us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging
technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized
crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external
parties or fraud on the part of employees.

85

* * *

Table of Contents

  

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from
outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment
has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer
transactions. The related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new
cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies
on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and
although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security
capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase
exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk"
section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion of
Regions' information security risk.

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a
level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit
losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio
at the balance sheet date. The benefit from credit losses totaled $155 million
in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the provision for credit losses of
$113 million during the third quarter of 2020. The benefit from credit losses
totaled $634 million for the first nine months of 2021 compared to the
provision for credit losses of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020.
Refer to the "Allowance" section for further detail.

(1) The 2021 amount is a gain on the sale of an equity investment, whereas the
2020 amount is a valuation gain on the investment that was sold in the first
quarter 2021.

  

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges. The increases during the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 were the result of
elevated consumer spending in 2021 as the pace of economic activity continued
to accelerate. While service charge revenue improved, changes to customer
spending behaviors as a result of the pandemic, combined with enhancements to
overdraft practices and transaction posting procedures, are expected to keep
service charges approximately ten to fifteen percent below pre-pandemic
levels. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for further detail.

Card and ATM fees--Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit
card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. Card and ATM
fees increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2021
compared to the same periods of 2020, driven by increased debit card spending
and transaction volume.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage
income in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was
due primarily to lower mortgage refinance production. The decrease in mortgage
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to lower mortgage
refinance production in the second and third quarters compared to the elevated
production volume experienced in the same periods in 2020, as well as losses
on mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. Capital markets income increased in the third
quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods
in 2020 primarily due to increases in merger and acquisition advisory fees and
loan syndication revenue. Additionally, capital markets income for the nine
months ended 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 benefited from increases
in securities and underwriting placement fees and fees generated from the
placement of permanent financing for real estate.

Investment management and trust fee income--Investment management and trust
fee income represents income from asset management services provided to
individuals, businesses and institutions. Investment management and trust fee
income increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 compared
to the same periods of 2020 due primarily to favorable market conditions and
an increase in sales.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance income primarily
represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of
insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned
life insurance increased during the the first nine months of 2021 compared to
the same period of 2020 due primarily to an $18 million individual BOLI claim
benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2021.

Investment services fee income--Investment services fee income represents
income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee
income increased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2021
compared to the same periods of 2020 due primarily to stronger financial
advisor production and favorable market conditions.

Commercial credit fee income--Commercial credit fee income includes letters of
credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Commercial credit fee
income increased during the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same
period of 2020 primarily driven by an increase in unused commercial line fees.
While line utilization reached an inflection point in the second quarter of
2021, overall credit line utilization remains lower than the same period of
2020.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations
related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments are
offset in salaries and benefits.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check
fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the third quarter
and the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020
primarily due to increases in commercial loan and leasing related fee income
generated from the 2020 acquisition of Ascentium, SBIC income and increases in
the values of certain other equity investments.

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2021,
salaries and benefits expense increased compared to the same periods in 2020
primarily driven by higher variable-based compensation associated with
elevated fee income. Also contributing to the increase for the first nine
months of 2021 was an increase in 401(k) and other benefits expenses as a
result of positive market valuation adjustments,. A decline in base salaries
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 partially offset the
increases in total salaries and benefits expense. Full-time equivalent
headcount decreased to 18,963 at September 30, 2021 from 19,766 at September
30, 2020, reflecting the continuing impact of the Company's efficiency
initiatives implemented as part of its strategic priorities.

Outside services--Outside services consists of expenses related to routine
services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs,
data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data
subscriptions, and check printing. Outside services decreased during the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020
due primarily to Regions exiting a third party lending relationship.

Table of Contents

  

Credit/Checkcard expenses--Credit/Checkcard expenses include credit and
checkcard fraud and expenses. Credit/checkcard increased in the first nine
months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an
increase in debit card fraud.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt--During the third quarter of 2021,
Regions redeemed its 3.80% senior bank notes and incurred related early
extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $20 million. During the first nine
months of 2020, Regions incurred early extinguishment charges of $8 million
related to the redemption of two Regions Bank senior notes and early
terminations of FHLB advances.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses
and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2021
was $180 million compared to $104 million for the three months ended September
30, 2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.7 percent and 16.5 percent,
respectively. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 was $591 million compared to $99 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 22.1 percent and 17.1
percent, respectively. The Company expects the full-year tax rate to range
from approximately 22 percent to 23 percent for 2021, excluding the impact of
unanticipated discrete items and the impact of potential tax legislation.

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited
to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax
jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax
benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance
income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the
effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but
are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain
leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and
changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the
effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

At September 30, 2021, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of
$430 million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $505 million at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the net deferred tax liability was
primarily due to the decrease in unrealized gains on available for sale
securities and derivative instruments, which was partially offset by a
decrease in the deferred tax asset related to allowance for loan losses.

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance
company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to
increase business loans and leases to small business customers using
Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities.

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of
assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired,
$1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial
and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were
long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of
the borrowings, and as of September 30, 2021, $30 million of long-term debt
remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair value.

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on
the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered
to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price
less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is
recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition,
which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related
to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset
value as part of the acquisition. The non-credit discount related to
Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans were
immaterial.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of
$348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. Purchase accounting
adjustments of $16 million reduced goodwill during the measurement period.
Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other
intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life
of each recognized asset.

through the first quarter of 2022. Regions did not repurchase any outstanding

temporary pause in share repurchases until the EnerBank closing on October 1,
2021.
