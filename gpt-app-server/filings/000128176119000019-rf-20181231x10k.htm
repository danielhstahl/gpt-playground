Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical
information, but rather are related to future operations, strategies,
financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based
on management's current expectations as well as certain assumptions and
estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the
statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are
subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are
likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections
expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any
of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other
factors include, but are not limited to, the risks identified in Item 1A.

Supervision and Regulation

We are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and
their subsidiaries. This framework is intended primarily for the protection of
depositors, the FDIC's DIF and the banking system as a whole, and generally is
not intended for the protection of stockholders or other investors. Described
below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to
us and our subsidiaries. These descriptions are not intended to be complete
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the
statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation,
and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other
governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Overview

We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a BHC and have elected to be
treated as an FHC under the BHC Act. As such, we and our subsidiaries are
subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC
Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Generally, the BHC Act
provides for "umbrella" regulation of FHCs by the Federal Reserve and
functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory
agencies. The BHC Act also requires the Federal Reserve to examine any
subsidiary of a BHC, other than a depository institution, engaged in
activities permissible for a depository institution. The Federal Reserve is
also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of,
examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company subsidiary.

Regions Bank is a member of the FDIC, and, as such, its deposits are insured
by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. Regions Bank is an Alabama state-
chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Its operations are
generally subject to supervision and examination by both the Federal Reserve
and the Alabama State Banking Department and the bank regulators are given
authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the
establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The federal and state
banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or
development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.
State and federal laws and regulations govern the activities in which Regions
Bank engages, including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of
loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance
laws and regulations also affect its operations. Regions Bank is also affected
by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it implements monetary policy. As a
Federal Reserve System member bank, Regions Bank is required to hold stock in
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in an amount equal to 6 percent of its
capital stock and surplus. Member banks with total assets in excess of $10
billion, including Regions Bank, receive a floating dividend rate tied to
10-year U.S. Treasuries, with the maximum dividend rate capped at 6 percent.

Regions Bank and its affiliates are also subject to supervision, regulation,
examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection
laws and regulations. Some of Regions' non-bank subsidiaries are also subject
to regulation by various federal and state agencies, such as the SEC and FINRA
in the case of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Regions Securities LLC and
BlackArch Securities LLC.

We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Our
common stock and depository shares representing our outstanding preferred
stock are each listed on the NYSE. Consequently, we are also subject to the
NYSE's rules for listed companies.

Under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by EGRRCPA, which was
signed into law on May 24, 2018, U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of
$100 billion or more but less than $250 billion, including Regions, are
currently subject to enhanced prudential standards. The enhanced prudential
standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity
standards, risk management and risk committee requirements, stress test
requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC has
determined would pose a grave threat to systemic financial stability were they
to fail such limits. In general, EGRRCPA increased the statutory asset
threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply these enhanced
prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion. Although EGRRCPA's
increased asset threshold took effect immediately for BHCs with total
consolidated assets less than $100 billion, the increased asset threshold for
BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more but less than $250
billion, including Regions, generally will become effective 18 months after
the date of enactment (that is, November 2019). The Federal Reserve is
authorized, however, during that 18-month period to exempt, by order, any BHC
with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion from any enhanced prudential
standard requirement. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to apply any
enhanced prudential standard requirement to any BHC with between $100 billion
and $250 billion in total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt
under EGRRCPA, if the Federal Reserve determines that such action is
appropriate to address risks to financial stability and promote safety and
soundness, taking into consideration certain factors including the BHC's
capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including
financial activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related
factors that the Federal Reserve deems appropriate. BHCs with $250 billion or
more in total consolidated assets remain fully subject to the Dodd-Frank Act's
enhanced prudential standards requirements.

In October 2018, pursuant to the discretion afforded them with respect to BHCs
with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, the Federal Reserve and the
other Federal bank regulators proposed rules that would tailor the application
of the enhanced prudential standards to BHCs and depository institutions per
the EGRRCPA amendments (the "Tailoring NPRs"). The Tailoring NPRs would assign
each U.S. BHC with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well
as its bank subsidiaries, to one

  

10

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

of four categories based on its size and five risk-based indicators: (1)
cross-jurisdictional activity, (2) weighted short-term wholesale funding, (3)
non-bank assets, (4) off-balance sheet exposure, and (5) status as a U.S.
global systemically important BHC ("G-SIB"). Under the Tailoring NPRs,
Category IV standards would apply to banking organizations with at least $100
billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds
specified for Categories I through III.

The Federal Reserve staff indicated in connection with the Tailoring NPRs the
firms that would fall into each of the four Categories based on data for the
second quarter of 2018. According to the Federal Reserve's projections,
Regions (and, pursuant to the proposed rules, its depository institution
subsidiary, Regions Bank) would be a "Category IV" firm under each of the
Tailoring NPRs, although the thresholds for each of the four categories could
change in the final rules. Firms that would be subject to Category IV
standards, such as Regions and Regions Bank, would generally be subject to the
same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with less than $100 billion
in total consolidated assets, but would also be required to monitor and report
certain risk-based indicators. Accordingly, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category
IV firms would, among other things, (1) no longer be subject to any LCR or
proposed NSFR requirement, (2) no longer be subject to company-run capital
stress testing requirements and (3) become subject to supervisory capital
stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis. The Tailoring NPRs are
subject to modification through the federal rulemaking process in accordance
with the Administrative Procedures Act. A chart summarizing key elements of
the capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential standards requirements
applicable to Regions should the Tailoring NPRs be adopted is included
immediately below, and elements of the Tailoring NPRs are discussed in further
detail throughout this section.

† The Tailoring NPR does not amend the Federal Reserve's capital plan rule,
but the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to release a future proposal
to do so, consistent with the changes to its stress testing rules.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by EGRRCPA, BHCs with total
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as Regions, are required to
submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the
company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its
material financial distress or failure. Regions submitted its most recent
resolution plan to these agencies in December 2017 and Regions Bank submitted
its most recent resolution plan in June 2018. If the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC determine that these plans are not credible and we do not cure the
deficiencies, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more
stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on
growth, activities or operations

of the Company or Regions Bank or may jointly order the Company or Regions
Bank to divest assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution in the
event of failure. Currently, Regions is required to submit a resolution plan
by December 31, 2019, and Regions Bank will not be required to submit a
resolution plan before July 1, 2020; however, in connection with the release
of the Tailoring NPRs, the Federal Reserve noted that it expects to release a
separate proposal to amend, with the FDIC, their joint resolution plan rule to
address the applicability of resolution plan requirements for U.S. BHCs with
between $100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets, including
Regions, and to adjust the scope and applicability of resolution plan
requirements for firms that remain subject to them.

The ultimate benefits or consequences of EGRRCPA and the Tailoring NPRs on
Regions, Regions Bank and their respective subsidiaries and activities will be
subject to the final form of the Tailoring NPRs and additional rulemakings
issued by the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators. Regions cannot
predict future changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory
agency policies, yet such changes may have a material impact on Regions'
business, financial condition or results of operations. We will continue to
evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated,
including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer
products or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the
enhanced supervision provisions, among others.

On February 5, 2019 the Federal Reserve provided relief to BHCs with assets
between $100 billion and $250 billion, including Regions, in the form of a
one-year extension to the requirement to submit a capital plan to the Federal
Reserve. Thus, Regions must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve by
April 5, 2020, rather than April 5, 2019. In addition, Regions is not subject
to the supervisory capital stress testing or the company-run capital stress
testing requirements for 2019. However, Regions is still required to maintain
a capital plan that is reviewed and approved by Regions' Board of Directors.
Furthermore, while Regions is not required to submit a full capital plan to
the Federal Reserve in 2019, the Company is required to submit its planned
capital actions for the period between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The
Federal Reserve has announced that for the period from July 1, 2019 through
June 30, 2020, Regions, like other firms granted an extension, is approved to
make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed the firm
to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for
any changes in Regions' regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve
acted on Regions' 2018 capital plan.

Permissible Activities under the BHC Act

In general, the BHC Act limits the activities permissible for BHCs to the
business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities
as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as
to be properly incidental thereto. A BHC electing to be treated as a FHC, like
Regions, may also engage in a range of activities that are (i) financial in
nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a
financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and
soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally.
These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making,
insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance
company portfolio investments.

For a BHC to be eligible to elect FHC status, all of its subsidiary insured
depository institutions must be well-capitalized and well-managed as described
below under "-Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA" and must have received at
least a satisfactory rating on such institution's most recent examination
under the CRA. The BHC itself must also be well-capitalized and well-managed
in order to be eligible to elect FHC status. If an FHC fails to continue to be
well-capitalized or well-managed after engaging in activities not permissible
for BHCs that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies,
the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply
with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does
not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the
company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to
discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities
permissible only for a BHC electing to be treated as an FHC. Furthermore, if
the Federal Reserve determines that an FHC has not maintained a CRA rating of
at least "satisfactory," the FHC would not be able to commence any new
financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities,
although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely
related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting
banking activities.

The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible non-banking
activities of BHCs. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any BHC or its
subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or
control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to
believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control
constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of
any bank subsidiary of the BHC.

Capital Requirements

Regions and Regions Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital
adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the
Basel III framework.

The Basel III-based U.S. capital rules, among other things, impose a capital
measure called Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, or CET1 capital, to which most
deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made. In
addition, the Basel III-based U.S. capital rules specify that Tier 1 capital
consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting certain
specified requirements.

Under the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules, the minimum capital ratios are:

  

12

|

4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets;

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

4.0% tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under U.S.
Basel III Standardized approach (known as the "leverage ratio").  
  
The U.S. capital rules also impose a capital conservation buffer ("CCB") on
top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios listed above. As of
January 1, 2019, the CCB has been fully phased-in and is 2.5%. Banking
institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the CCB is
taken into account (that is, 7.0% for CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets,
8.5% for tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 10.5% for total capital to
risk-weighted assets) will be subject to constraints on capital distributions,
including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive
compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the
shortfall and the institution's "eligible retained income" (that is, four
quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not
reflected in net income). On April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a
proposal designed to create a single, integrated capital requirement by
combining the quantitative assessment of firms' capital plans with the CCB
requirement. Details of this proposal are discussed under "\- Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review and Stress Testing" below. Although the proposal,
if adopted, would change the way in which the minimum ratios are calculated,
firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints
on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios.

For more information, see the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Item 7\.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Leverage Requirements

BHCs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage capital
requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total consolidated average tangible assets (as defined for regulatory
purposes), called the "leverage ratio," of 4.0% for all BHCs.

Liquidity Requirements

Liquidity risk management and supervision have become increasingly important
since the financial crisis. In addition to the liquidity buffer requirement,
Regions is currently subject to the federal banking agencies' rules
implementing Basel III's LCR, which is designed to ensure that a covered bank
or BHC maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
under an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR rule, following the
threshold amendments under EGRRCPA, currently applies in a modified, less
stringent, form to BHCs, such as Regions, having $100 billion or more but less
than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in
total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. Since January 1, 2017, the rule has
been fully phased-in. Regions is required to calculate its LCR on a monthly
basis. If a covered company fails to meet the required LCR, it must promptly
notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take
remedial actions. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule
that requires BHCs currently subject to the LCR rule, such as Regions, to
disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative and qualitative
information about certain components of its LCR beginning with the fourth
quarter of 2018 for modified LCR BHCs such as Regions. At December 31, 2018,
Regions' LCR was above the minimum requirement. As noted above, under the
Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, including Regions, would no longer be
subject to any LCR requirement.

In addition to LCR, the Basel III framework also included a second standard,
referred to as the NSFR, which is designed to promote more medium- and long-
term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time
horizon. In May 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule to
implement the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations. Under the 2016
proposal, BHCs with less than $250 billion, but more than $50 billion, in
total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet
foreign exposure, such as Regions, would have been subject to a less stringent
modified NSFR requirement. As proposed, the NSFR rule would have taken effect
on January 1, 2018; however, the U.S. banking regulators have not issued the
final rule. As noted above, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms,
including Regions, would no longer be subject to any NSFR requirement.

Under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, including Regions, would remain
subject to liquidity risk management requirements, but these requirements
would be tailored such that these firms would be required to: (i) calculate
collateral positions monthly, as opposed to weekly as is currently required;
(ii) establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than are currently
required; and (iii) monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk
exposures than are currently monitored. These firms would also be subject to
liquidity stress testing quarterly, rather than monthly, and would be required
to report liquidity data on the FR 2052a on a monthly basis. The liquidity
buffer requirements for these firms would not change.

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Stress Testing

The Federal Reserve currently conducts annual analyses of BHCs with at least
$100 billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the companies
have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in
baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic conditions (although, in light
of EGRRCPA's eliminating the statutory requirement for the adverse scenario,
on January 8, 2019, the Federal Reserve proposed amendments to its stress
testing rules that would, among other things, eliminate the adverse scenario).
Regions is also currently required to conduct its own semi-annual stress
analysis to assess the potential impact on Regions of the economic and
financial conditions used as part of the Federal Reserve's annual stress
analysis. Under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, including Regions,
would be subject to supervisory stress testing every other year, rather than
annually, and would no longer be subject to company-run stress testing
requirements, but would remain subject to the quantitative review of their
capital plans under CCAR, to required capital plan submissions, and to the FR
Y-14 reporting requirements.

U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as
Regions, must develop and maintain a capital plan, and must submit the capital
plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. The
CCAR process is intended to help ensure that these BHCs have robust, forward-
looking capital planning processes that account for each company's unique
risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and
financial stress. In connection with the release of the Tailoring NPRs, the
Federal Reserve noted that it expects to revise its guidance relating to
capital planning to align with the proposed categories of standards set forth
in the Tailoring NPRs, and the impact of the future proposal on Regions and
its capital planning process will depend on the final form of the Federal
Reserve's revised guidance.

As noted above, on April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal
designed to create a single, integrated capital requirement by combining the
quantitative assessment of CCAR with the CCB requirement. If adopted, the
proposal would replace the current static 2.5% CCB with a SCB requirement. The
SCB, subject to a minimum of 2.5%, would reflect stressed losses in the
supervisory severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve's supervisory
stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock
dividends. The proposal would also introduce a SLB requirement, similar to the
SCB, which would apply to the Tier 1 leverage ratio. In addition, the proposal
would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of CCAR but would
require a BHC to reduce its planned capital distributions if those
distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer
constraints based on the BHC's own baseline scenario projections. The Federal
Reserve has stated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer
requirements that would be applicable to Category IV BHCs to align with the
proposed two-year supervisory stress testing cycle for Category IV BHCs.

In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital
distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) is contingent on the
Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Should the Federal
Reserve object to a capital plan, a BHC may not make any capital distribution
other than those capital distributions to which the Federal Reserve has
indicated its non-objection in writing. As a result of a final rule adopted by
the Federal Reserve in January 2017, beginning with the 2017 CCAR cycle, the
Federal Reserve may no longer object on the basis of qualitative criteria to
capital plans submitted by BHCs that have total consolidated assets of at
least $50 billion but less than $250 billion, non-bank assets of less than $75
billion, and that are not U.S. global-systemically important banks, such as
Regions. Our annual capital planning submission is currently due by April 5th
and the Federal Reserve will publish the results of its supervisory CCAR
review of our capital plan by June 30th of each year. As noted above, the
Tailoring NPR, which would change the supervisory stress testing cycle from
annual to biennial, would not similarly amend the Federal Reserve's capital
plan rule, but the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to release a
future proposal to do so.

Safety and Soundness Standards

The FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective
action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified
capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories ("well-
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized"), and the federal banking
agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized
to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically
undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary
supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution
is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the
banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that
is critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2018, both Regions and
Regions Bank were well-capitalized.

An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital
levels may be treated as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is
adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may
be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly
undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound
condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an
acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking
regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be
accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that
a subsidiary depository

  

14

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain
limitations. The BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance.

The FDIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-
capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations
and management, asset quality, and executive compensation and permits
regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such
standards. Regulators also must take into consideration: (i) concentrations of
credit risk; (ii) interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an
institution's assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its
off-balance sheet position); and (iii) risks from non-traditional activities,
as well as an institution's ability to manage those risks, when determining
the adequacy of an institution's capital. Regulators make this evaluation as a
part of their regular examination of the institution's safety and soundness.
Additionally, regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to
evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

Payment of Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other
subsidiaries. The principal source of cash flow to us, including cash flow to
pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on any of our
outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and
regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as
well as by us to our stockholders.

If, in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency, an institution under
its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound
practice, such agency may require, after notice and hearing, that such
institution cease and desist from such practice. The federal bank regulatory
agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's
capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking
practice. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay a dividend if
payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is
undercapitalized. See "-Safety and Soundness Standards" above. Moreover, the
Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that BHCs
and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating
earnings.

Payment of Dividends by Regions Bank. Under the Federal Reserve's Regulation
H, Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or
pay a dividend to us if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year
exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank's net income for that year and (b) its
retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required
transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of
preferred stock.

Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90% of its
net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least 20% of capital. Regions
Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama
Superintendent of Banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of
all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the
total of (a) Regions Bank's net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained
net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus. The statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings
from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and
other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating
expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all
federal, state and local taxes. Regions Bank cannot, without approval from the
Federal Reserve and the Alabama Superintendent of Banking, declare or pay a
dividend to Regions unless Regions Bank is able to satisfy the criteria
discussed above.

Payment of Dividends by Regions. Our payment of dividends to our stockholders
is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. In particular, the
dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC, such as Regions, are
reviewed by the Federal Reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of
the CCAR process and stress tests as submitted by the BHC, and will be
assessed against, among other things, the BHC's ability to achieve the
required capital ratios under the Basel III Rules as they are phased in by
U.S. regulators. See "-Capital Requirements" and "-Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review and Stress Testing" above.

Support of Subsidiary Banks

Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy, which has been codified by the
Dodd-Frank Act, Regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength
to, and to commit resources to support, its subsidiary bank. This support may
be required at times when Regions may not be inclined to provide it. In
addition, any capital loans by a BHC to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such
subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC's bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC
to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary
bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
payment.

Transactions with Affiliates

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's
Regulation W restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates,
including a parent BHC. Regions Bank is subject to these restrictions, which
include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of
transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to
affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of
assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These
restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be
collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market

terms or better for the bank. Generally, a bank's covered transactions with
any affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank's capital stock and surplus and
covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank's
capital stock and surplus.

Deposit Insurance

Regions Bank accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC
insurance up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits
may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository
institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law,
regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank's federal regulatory
agency.

Deposit Insurance Assessments. Regions Bank pays deposit insurance premiums to
the FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. FDIC assessment
rates for large institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets, such
as Regions Bank, are calculated based on a "scorecard" methodology that seeks
to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail
and the magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a
failure occurs, based primarily on the difference between the institution's
average of total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC has the ability
to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon
significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard.
For large institutions, including Regions Bank, after accounting for potential
base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to
40 basis points on an annualized basis.

The FDIA established a minimum ratio of the DIF to estimated insured deposits
of 1.15% prior to September 2020 and 1.35% thereafter. Beginning July 1, 2016,
the FDIC imposed a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured
depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more,
such as Regions Bank, that continued through September 30, 2018, when the
reserve ratio of the DIF first reached 1.36%, exceeding the future statutorily
required minimum of 1.35%. Because the statutory minimum was reached, the
surcharge no longer applies. The surcharge was enacted to continue through the
earlier of the quarter that the DIF first reaches or exceeds 1.35% or December
31, 2018. During 2018, the DIF reached the 1.35% minimum and the surcharge was
discontinued beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018 assessment. During
2018, Regions Bank's total FDIC insurance assessments and surcharge were $85
million, a $23 million decrease from 2017. We cannot predict whether, as a
result of an adverse change in economic conditions or other reasons, the FDIC
will increase deposit insurance assessment levels in the future.

For more information, see the "FDIC Insurance Assessments" section of Item 7\.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions

The BHC Act requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal
Reserve before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of
any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such
acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of
the voting shares of the institution; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries,
other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any
bank or savings and loan association; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate
with any other BHC. FHCs with consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion must
obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring certain non-
bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion. FHCs seeking
approval to complete an acquisition must be well-capitalized and well-managed.
Currently, BHCs with consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion must also
provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring direct or
indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company having
consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. EGRRCPA amended this requirement
to apply only to BHCs with consolidated assets exceeding $250 billion,
effective November 24, 2019.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any
transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any
combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business
of banking in any section of the U.S., or the effect of which may be
substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any
section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of
trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are
clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs
of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to
consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the
BHCs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be
served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital
adequacy, and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to
be served includes the parties' performance under the CRA. The Federal Reserve
must also take into account the institutions' effectiveness in combating money
laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act was
amended to require the Federal Reserve to, when evaluating a proposed
transaction, consider the extent to which the transaction would result in
greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or
financial system.

Depositor Preference

Under federal law, claims of depositors and certain claims for both
administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured
depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general
unsecured claims against such an institution in the "liquidation or other
resolution" of such an institution by any receiver.

Volcker Rule

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in
proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain
relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds
that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the Volcker
Rule. The final rules implementing the Volcker Rule also require that large
BHCs, such as Regions, design and implement compliance programs to ensure
adherence to the Volcker Rule's prohibitions. Development and monitoring of
the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and
management attention. In July 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and
SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to tailor the application
of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scope of a banking entity's trading
activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and
exemptions. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule will
depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance
from the relevant U.S. federal regulatory agencies and the development of
market practices and standards.

Consumer Protection Laws

We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws,
including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various
sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited
to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth
in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act,
and their respective state law counterparts.

The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under
various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws
referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has
finalized a number of significant rules, including rules that impact nearly
every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage loan. The CFPB also
has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository
institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including the authority to
prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering
of consumer financial products.

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection
laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal
level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to
enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.

Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of
banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information
about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require
disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-
affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is
used in diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In
addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among
affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a
product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and
application information. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and
other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and
experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or
services.

The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding
cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among
financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish
multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes
address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial
institution's management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to
effectively respond and recover the institution's operations after a cyber-
attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate
processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical
service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack.
The Regions Information Security Program reflects the requirements of this
guidance.

State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy
and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have
adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement
cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to
these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also
recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data
privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those
areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states
in which our customers are located.

Community Reinvestment Act

Regions Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
CRA, Regions Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with
safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its communities,
including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. The CRA requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory
agency, in connection with its examination of a depository institution, to
assess such institution's record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of
the community served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment is part of the Federal
Reserve's consideration of applications by a bank or BHC to acquire, merge or
consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to
establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an
office. In the case of a BHC applicant, the Federal Reserve will assess the
records of each subsidiary

depository institution of the applicant BHC, and such records may be the basis
for denying the application. In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury
issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes
to the CRA's implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and
associated burden on banks. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any
changes to the regulations implementing the CRA.

Compensation Practices

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve.
The federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that
incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account
risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth
the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation
arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives
that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does
not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii)
the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk
management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate
governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to
incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the
organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make
acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also provides that
enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its
incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or
governance processes pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness.

Anti-Money Laundering

A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in
recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The
USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations
to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers,
investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of
the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title
III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions,
including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program
that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations
regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an
account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned
accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money
laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure
of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act's requirements
could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Regions' banking subsidiary has augmented its systems and procedures to meet
the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update
their policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA
PATRIOT Act and implementing regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires
federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in
combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank
acquisition.

In May 2016, FinCEN, which drafts regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act
and other anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act legislation, issued final
rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership
information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions
conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions, and financial
institutions that are subject to these final rules, including Regions, were
required to comply by May 2018. Bank regulators are focusing their
examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor
and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with
designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known
as the "OFAC" rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury
Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions
targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they
contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with
or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct
or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions
on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making
investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a
sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or
specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by
prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including
property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g.,
property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or
transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with
these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Regulation of Broker Dealers

Our subsidiaries, Regions Securities LLC and BlackArch Securities LLC, are
registered broker-dealers with the SEC and, as a result, are subject to
regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory
organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including
capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and
securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping
and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material
non-public information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and
limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition
to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration
of certain broker-dealers.

Competition

All aspects of our business are highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete
with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate
and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in major financial centers
and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations,
credit unions, Internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance
companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and
financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. We
expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies given
the relatively low interest rate and slower economic environment relative to
past economic cycles. Also, future changes in monetary policy , coupled with
post-crisis regulatory requirements, may increase competition for certain
deposit products.

Customers for banking services and other financial services offered by our
subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service,
personal contacts, price of services and availability of products. Although
our position varies in different markets, we believe that our affiliates
effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant
market areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, Regions and its subsidiaries had 19,969 full-time
equivalent employees.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risk, some of which, including market,
liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic
risks, could be substantial and is inherent in our business. This risk also
includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease
considerably, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment
could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below are risk factors that could
adversely affect our financial results and condition, as well as the value of,
and return on investment in the Company.

Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business

Our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

We provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as
well as other financial services including asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and
other specialty financing. All of our businesses are materially affected by
conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the Southeastern U.S., the principal markets in which we
conduct business. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have
adverse effects on our business, including the following:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products
and services offered by us;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by
consumer or commercial real estate;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in
interest rates; and  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent,
file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other
obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming
assets, net charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and valuation adjustments
on loans held for sale.  
  
In the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or
specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can
be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would
intervene. If economic conditions worsen or volatility increases, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results
and condition.

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business.
We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer
deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come
due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and
unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market
stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our
activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors
that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy
generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity
sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and
operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to
deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In
particular, a majority of our liabilities during 2018 were checking accounts
and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days'
notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were loans,
which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have
historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary,
we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a
large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of
the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., and adverse changes
in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our financial
results and condition.

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., particularly in the
states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. As
a result, local economic conditions in the Southeastern U.S. significantly
affect the demand for the loans and other products we offer to our customers
(including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the ability of
borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these
loans. Following the financial crisis, the national real estate market
experienced a significant decline in value, and the value of real estate in
Florida in particular declined significantly more than real estate values in
the U.S. as a whole. This decline has had an adverse impact on some of our
borrowers and on the value of the collateral securing many of our loans.
Although real estate in many geographies has improved, any further declines in
the future may affect borrowers and collateral values, which could adversely
affect our currently performing loans, leading to future delinquencies or
defaults and increases in our provision for loan losses. Further or continued
adverse changes in these economic conditions could materially adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Weather-related events and other natural disasters, as well as man-made
disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences
that could have an adverse impact on financial results and condition.

A significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the
Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, regions that are susceptible to
hurricanes, or in areas of the Southeastern U.S. that are susceptible to
tornadoes and other severe weather events. In particular, in recent years, a
number of severe Atlantic Ocean hurricanes impacted areas in our footprint.
Many areas in the Southeastern U.S. have also experienced severe droughts and
floods in recent years. Any of these, or any other severe weather event, could
cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on
our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. While we
maintain insurance covering many of these weather-related events, including
coverage for lost profits and extra expense, there is no insurance against the
disruption that a catastrophic earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or other
severe weather event could produce to the markets that we serve and the
resulting adverse impact on our borrowers to timely repay their loans and the
value of any collateral held by us. The severity and impact of future
earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other weather-
related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global
climate change. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the Gulf of
Mexico or Atlantic Ocean, such as oil spills, could have similar effects.

If we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than
anticipated, our earnings may be materially adversely affected.

As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to
repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral
securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure
repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan
portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of
factors. Our management periodically determines the allowance for loan losses
based on available information, including the quality of the loan portfolio,
economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of
non-accrual loans. Increases in the allowance will result in an expense for
the period, thereby reducing our reported net income. If, as a result of
general economic conditions, there is a decrease in asset quality or growth in
the loan portfolio, management determines that additional increases in the
allowance for loan losses are necessary, we may incur additional expenses
which will reduce our net income, and our business, results of operations or
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Although our management will establish an allowance for loan losses it
believes is appropriate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in
our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. For example, if a
hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal
markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate
unexpectedly, additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing
allowance for loan losses may occur. Losses in excess of the existing
allowance for loan losses will reduce our net income and could adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps
materially.

In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance
for loan losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and to real
estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us
to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

As discussed in greater detail below, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, is effective January 1,
2020, and will substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans
and other financial assets. The standard removes the existing "probable"
threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies
to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial
assets. The adoption of the standard may result in an overall material
increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the impact at adoption
will be influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption
date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time.

Weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our
performance.

As of December 31, 2018, consumer residential real estate loans represented
approximately 28.3% of our total loan portfolio. Declines in home values would
adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate
that we hold, as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we
realize on the sale of real estate loans. These factors could result in higher
delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our
performance.

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 7.7% of our loan portfolio consisted of
investor real estate loans. The properties securing income-producing investor
real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the
loan. The borrower's ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon
additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower's successful
operation of a business. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrower's
business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such
economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of
these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may
increase. High vacancy rates could also result in rents falling. The
combination of these factors could result in deterioration in the fundamentals
underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value

of some of our loans. Any such deterioration could adversely affect the
ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans. As a
result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien
position could materially adversely affect our performance.

Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien
position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a
higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes
both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $9.3 billion home equity
portfolio at December 31, 2018, approximately $5.9 billion were home equity
lines of credit and $3.4 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily
originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a
first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to
borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time
of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in
addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of
potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk
because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the
collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien
position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $3.1
billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position.

Weakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance.

Many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly
impacted by changes in commodity prices. This includes agriculture, livestock,
metals, timber, textiles and energy businesses (including oil, gas and
petrochemical), as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities
prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment
used in production of commodities. Changes in commodity products prices depend
on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and
demand for the relevant commodity. These industries have been, and may in the
future be, subject to significant volatility. In addition, legislative changes
such as the elimination of certain tax incentives could have significant
impacts on this portfolio.

Industry competition may adversely affect our degree of success.

Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate
in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to remain
intense among financial services companies given the relatively low interest
rate and slower economic environment relative to past economic cycles. In our
market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings and
loan associations, credit unions, Internet banks, finance companies, mutual
funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage
companies, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services.
Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive
regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing
for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of marketplace
lenders and other technological financial services companies have grown
significantly over recent years and is expected to continue growing, including
further entry into offering traditional banking products and the possibility
of obtaining bank or bank-like charters, such as the OCC's fintech charter.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including
customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, pricing and range
of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and to
retain our current customers, our business, financial condition or results of
operations may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In particular, if we
experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking
investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, we may be
forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to
operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting
our net interest margin and financial performance.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.

Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income and
other financing income, which is the difference between the interest income
received on interest-earning assets (primarily loans and investment
securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-
bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). Net interest income
and other financing income also includes rental income and depreciation
expense associated with operating leases for which Regions is the lessor. The
level of net interest income and other financing income is primarily a
function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average
balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on
such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by
both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local
economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC
and interest rates markets.

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based
on short-term interest rates, the level of which is influenced heavily by the
FOMC's actions. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are
typically driven by both short-term and longer-term interest rates. Longer-
term rates are affected by multiple factors including the actions of the FOMC
through actions such as quantitative easing or tightening, and the market's
expectations for future inflation, growth and other economic considerations.
The level of net interest income and other financing income is, therefore,
influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the shape of the
yield curve. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create
unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our interest-
bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our
interest-earning assets, our net interest income and other financing income
may decline.

  

22

Our net interest income and other financing income would be similarly affected
if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace
than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates
remain low by historical standards; however, while still low relative to
historical standards, increases in short term and long term interest rates
since December 2015 have contributed to growth in net interest income and
other financing income and the net interest margin.

Our current one-year interest rate sensitivity position is asset sensitive. As
a result, an immediate or gradual decrease in rates over a twelve-month period
would likely have a negative impact on twelve-month net interest income and
other financing income. Conversely, an increasing rate environment would
likely have a positive impact on twelve-month net interest income and other
financing income. However, increasing rates would also increase debt service
requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely affect those
borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in
additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.

For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies
for these risks, see the "Net Interest Income and Other Financing Income,
Margin and Interest Rate Risk," "Net Interest Income and Other Financing
Income and Margin," "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Securities" sections
of Item 7\. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates
are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the
products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine
their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark
rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket or other financial
metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent
national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for
reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the FCA announced that the FCA
intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the
calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the
continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed
after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether
and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the
calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR
will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or
rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any
such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked
financial instruments.

Certain of our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but
not limited to, hedging products, debt obligations, investments, and loans,
extend beyond 2021. We are in the process of assessing the impact that a
cessation or market replacement of LIBOR would have on these various products
and contracts.

Any future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and
place limitations on business activities related to providing credit support
to customers.

The major ratings agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based
on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions
affecting the financial services industry generally. In general, ratings
agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors,
including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level
and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit
ratings. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to
change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take
action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future. Additionally,
ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies
and practices, which may affect our credit ratings. In the future, changes to
existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may, among other
things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in
which we have an economic interest.

Regions' credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our
ability to access the debt and capital markets, as well as reduce our
profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances. In addition,
certain customers could be prohibited from placing deposits with Regions Bank.
If Regions were to be downgraded below investment grade, we may not be able to
reliably access the short-term unsecured funding markets, and certain
customers could be prohibited from placing deposits with Regions Bank, which
could cause us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our ongoing
liquidity needs. Such actions could reduce our profitability as these liquid
investments earn a lower return than other assets, such as loans. Regions'
liquidity policy requires that the holding company maintain cash sufficient to
cover the greater of (i) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or
(ii) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Although this policy helps
protect us against the costs of unexpected adverse funding environments, we
cannot guarantee that this policy will be sufficient.

Additionally, if Regions were to be downgraded to below investment grade,
certain counterparty contracts may be required to be renegotiated or require
the posting of additional collateral. Refer to Note 21 "Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities - Contingent Features" to the consolidated
financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fair value of
contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings
associated with such contracts. Although the exact amount of additional
collateral is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that Regions may be
required to post additional collateral related to existing contracts with
contingent credit features.

The value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the
future.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $4.8 billion of goodwill and $115 million of
other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash
flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic
growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common
stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk
factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future
related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could
also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If we
were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we
would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit
intangibles, purchased credit card relationship assets, and the DUS license.
Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these
intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of
credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes
in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed
unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating
results and regulatory capital ratios.

As of December 31, 2018, Regions had approximately $20 million in net deferred
tax assets (net of valuation allowance of $30 million). Our deferred tax
assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that
they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this
determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available,
including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable
temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. We have determined
that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at
December 31, 2018 (except for $30 million related to state deferred tax assets
for which we have established a valuation allowance). If we were to conclude
that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely
than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely
affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital
ratios. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely
affected by a change in statutory tax rates.

Changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely
affect us.

Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading,
clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many
different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions
with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and
dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even mere speculation
about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services
industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead
to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these
transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our
counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the
collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not
sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or lease or derivative
exposure due us. Any such losses may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain
qualified employees.

Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key
personnel. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we
may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to
replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key
personnel. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and other regulators. As a large financial and
banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation
practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the Federal
Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators. These limitations could further affect
our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key
personnel, in particular as we are more often competing for personnel with
financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not
have the same limitations on compensation as we do. For a discussion of
proposed rules that may impact our compensation practices, see the
"Supervision and Regulation-Compensation Practices" section of Item 1\.
"Business" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Maintaining or increasing market share may depend on market acceptance and
regulatory approval of new products and services.

Our success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to
evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products
and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and other
financing income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services.
In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to
make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and
services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in
introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or
developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market
acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products
and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be
subject to cost increases, and our business, financial condition or results of
operations may be adversely affected.

We need to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet
customer demands.

The financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid
changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and
services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of
technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs. Our future
success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to provide
products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create
additional efficiencies in our operations. Some of our competitors have
substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than
we currently have. Further, financial technology providers, who invest
substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in
particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more
traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships)
and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a
bank-like charter, such as the OCC's fintech charter. We may not be able to
effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be
successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a
result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business
may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of
operations, may be adversely affected.

We are subject to a variety of operational risks, including the risk of fraud
or theft by employees, which may adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business
continuity, process, third party, information technology, human resource,
model, and fraud risks. Regions' fraud risks include fraud committed by
external parties against the Company or its customers and fraud committed
internally by our associates. Certain fraud risks, including identity theft
and account takeover may increase as a result of customers' account or
personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of
retailers' or other third parties' networks. We have established processes and
procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report and
analyze these risks; however, there are inherent limitations to our risk
management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that
we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. If our risk
management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we
may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our
systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and
government agencies. We may also suffer severe reputational damage. Any of
these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations. In particular, the unauthorized disclosure,
misappropriation, mishandling or misuse of personal, non-public, confidential
or proprietary information of customers could result in significant regulatory
consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.

Our ability to attract and retain customers and highly-skilled management and
employees is impacted by our reputation. A negative public opinion of us and
our business can result from any number of activities, including our lending
practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and
actions taken by our regulators or by community organizations in response to
these activities. Significant harm to our reputation could also arise as a
result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct
or the activities of our customers, other participants in the financial
services industry or our contractual counterparties, such as our service
providers and vendors. In particular, a cybersecurity event impacting us or
our customers' data could have a negative impact on our reputation and
customer confidence in Regions and its cybersecurity. Damage to our reputation
could also adversely affect our credit ratings and access to the capital
markets.

We are subject to a variety of systems failure and cybersecurity risks that
could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Failure in or breach of our systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-
party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers),
including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses or the
businesses of our customers. This could result in the disclosure or misuse of
confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our
costs and financial losses. As a large financial institution, we depend on our
ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions
on a continuous basis. As public and regulatory expectations, as well as our
customers' expectations have increased regarding operational performance and
information security, our systems and infrastructure must continue to be
safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.
Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other
operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become
disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that
are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be
electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as
earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; pandemics; events arising from local or
larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as
described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and
other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected
by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or
operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For a discussion
of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding
cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see the "Supervision and
Regulation-Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity" section of Item 1\. "Business"
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Information security risks for large financial institutions, such as Regions,
have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the
proliferation of Internet and mobile banking and the increased sophistication
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states,
activists and other external parties. This increase is expected to continue
and further intensify.

Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present
operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches
or failures of their own systems. As noted above, our operations rely on the
secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our
computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products and
services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and
other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Although we
believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls
designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cyber-attack or information
security breach, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers'
devices may be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches
that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse,
loss or destruction of Regions' or our customers' confidential, proprietary
and other information. We also have insurance coverage that may, subject to
policy terms and conditions, cover certain losses associated with cyber-
attacks or information security breaches, but it may be insufficient to cover
all losses from any such attack or breach. Additionally, cyber-attacks, such
as denial of service attacks, hacking or terrorist activities, could disrupt
Regions' or our customers' or other third parties' business operations. For
example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of
large financial services institutions, including Regions. Although these past
events have not resulted in a breach of Regions' client data or account
information, such attacks have adversely affected the performance of Regions
Bank's website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers
from accessing Regions Bank's secure websites for consumer and commercial
applications. In all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience;
however, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and
Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. As cyber
threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant
additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or
to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We may
also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory
investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyber-attack or information
security breach that impacts us. In addition, our third-party service
providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems or, once
identified, be unable to promptly provide required patches. Further, even if
provided, such patches may not fully remediate any vulnerability or may be
difficult for Regions to implement. The techniques used by cyber criminals
change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated
from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile
foreign governments. These criminals may attempt to fraudulently induce
employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive
information in order to gain access to data or our systems.

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems
that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security
breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access
our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory
fines, civil litigation, penalties or intervention, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, remediation costs, additional
cybersecurity protection costs, increased insurance premiums and/or additional
compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. We could also be adversely
affected if we lost access to information or services from a third-party
service provider as a result of a security breach, system or operational
failure or disruption affecting the third-party service provider. For a more
detailed discussion of these risks and specific occurrences, see the
"Information Security Risk" section of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the
information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with
these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational
damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as those modeled
after GDPR, are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply
with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-
compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may
significantly increase. In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject
to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data
use in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and
regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology
for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other
things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary
penalties for breach of such laws and regulations.

We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business
infrastructure.

Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data
processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces
and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected
these third-party vendors carefully, performing upfront due diligence and
ongoing monitoring activities, we do not control their actions. Any problems
caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in
services provided by a vendor (including as a result of a cyber-attack, other
information security event or a natural disaster), financial or operational
difficulties for the vendor, or resulting from issues at third-party vendors
to the vendors, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes,
failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, poor performance of
services, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or
misconduct on the part of employees of any of our vendors, could adversely
affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, our
reputation and our ability to conduct our business. In certain situation,
replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and
expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable,
inherent risk to our business operations.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and
counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with
clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on
behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other
financial information. We also

  

26

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy
and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial
statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this
information is inaccurate, we may be subject to regulatory action,
reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of
our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.

We are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to
property.

In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real
estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with
respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or
to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental
contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with
investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if
we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to
common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from
environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject
to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on the mortgage secondary market for some of our liquidity.

In 2018, we sold 45.6% of the mortgage loans we originated to the Agencies. We
rely on the Agencies to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan
requirements in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for
additional loans we desire to originate. We cannot provide assurance that the
Agencies will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to
capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other
factors. Additionally, various proposals have been made to reform the U.S.
residential mortgage finance market, including the role of the Agencies. The
exact effects of any such reforms are not yet known, but they may limit our
ability to sell conforming loans to the Agencies. If we are unable to continue
to sell conforming loans to the Agencies, our ability to fund, and thus
originate, additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected, which would
adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we
may conduct.

In connection with our sale of one or more loan portfolios, we may make
certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans
sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and
serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may
be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be
required to repurchase part or all of the effected loans. We may also be
required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of
early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If we are
required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a
remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to
recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases.
Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, we must report as held for sale any loans that we have undertaken
to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed.
We may, therefore, be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of
the loans we classify as held for sale. Management must exercise its judgment
in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status
to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. Any failure to
accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory
investigations and monetary penalties. Any of these actions could adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reclassifying loans
from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected
loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, any loans
classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by changes in interest
rates and by changes in the borrower's creditworthiness. We may be required to
reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

A downgrade or potential downgrade of the U.S. Government's sovereign credit
rating by one or more credit ratings agencies, and developments in
international trade, could adversely affect our business.

Future uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy could result in a downgrade or a
reduction in the outlook of the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating by one
or more credit ratings agencies. Any downgrade, or perceived future downgrade,
in the U.S. sovereign credit rating or outlook could adversely affect global
financial markets and economic conditions and may result in, among other
things, increased volatility and illiquidity in the capital markets, declines
in consumer confidence, increased unemployment levels and declines in the
value of U.S. Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by the U.S.
government. As a result, our business, liquidity, results of operations and
financial conditions may be adversely affected. Additionally, the economic
conditions resulting from any such downgrade or perceived future downgrade may
significantly exacerbate the other risks we face. In addition, unfavorable or
uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of
tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can
result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely
affect our businesses.

Our reported financial results depend on management's selection of accounting
methods and certain assumptions and estimates.

Our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported
financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise
judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and
methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management's judgment of the most
appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In

  

27

some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply
from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the
circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results
than would have been reported under a different alternative.

Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial
condition and results of operations. They require management to make
difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.
Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or
using different assumptions or estimates. The Company's critical accounting
estimates include: the allowance for credit losses; fair value measurements;
intangible assets; residential MSRs; and income taxes. Because of the
uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do
one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit
losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the
reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on our goodwill, other
intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances; or significantly increase
our accrued income taxes. Any of these actions could adversely affect our
reported financial condition and results of operations.

If the models that we use in our business perform poorly or provide inadequate
information, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.

We utilize quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or
predicting certain financial values. Models may be used in processes such as
determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending
credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, forecasting financial
performance, predicting losses, improving customer services, maintaining
adherence to laws and regulations, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating
regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial
instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed
models present the risk that our business decisions that consider information
based on such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy or
inaccuracy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or
to our regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models
could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators
make, including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders,
could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the
models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.

Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially
affect how we report our financial results and condition.

From time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and
reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.
These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we
record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that will, effective
January 1, 2020, substantially change the accounting for credit losses on
loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and
other organizations. The standard removes the existing "probable" threshold in
GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect
their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets.
Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected
credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve,
OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to
address this upcoming change to the allowance measurement and subsequent
concerns related to the impact on capital and capital planning. The rule
provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse
regulatory capital impact upon adoption of the standard. The impact of this
final rule on Regions and Regions Bank will depend on whether we elect to
phase in the impact of the standard over a three-year period. The adoption of
the standard may result in an overall material increase in the allowance for
credit losses. However, the impact at adoption will be influenced by the
portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as well as economic
conditions and forecasts at that time. It is also possible that Regions'
ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in
periods following adoption.

Risks Arising From the Legal and Regulatory Framework in which Our Business
Operates

We are, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, investigations and
governmental proceedings that may result in liabilities adversely affecting
our financial condition, business or results of operations or in reputational
harm.

We and our subsidiaries are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in
various class actions and other litigation, and may be the subject of
subpoenas, reviews, requests for information, investigations, and formal and
informal proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies regarding our
and their businesses and activities (including subpoenas, requests for
information and investigations related to the activities of our customers).
Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of
operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including
adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money
penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restrictions on our
business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even
if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause
significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the
operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse
judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation
by government or self-regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation,
investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or self-
regulatory agencies (including the inquiries mentioned above) begin
independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. In general, the
amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or
investigations, including those

  

28

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

relating to anti-money laundering matters or sales practices, have increased
substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental
authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part
of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for
a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the
ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain
businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition,
enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in
turn restrict or limit our activities.

In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of
borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal
theories, collectively termed "lender liability." Generally, lender liability
is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether
implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or
has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of
a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders.
In the future, Regions could become subject to claims based on this or other
evolving legal theories.

Additional information relating to our litigation, investigations and other
proceedings is discussed in Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

We may face significant claims for indemnification in connection with our sale
of Morgan Keegan in 2012.

In April 2012, Regions closed the sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates
to Raymond James. In connection with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify
Raymond James for all litigation and certain other matters related to pre-
closing activities of Morgan Keegan. Indemnifiable losses under the
indemnification provision include legal and other expenses, such as costs for
defense, judgments, settlements and awards associated with the resolution of
litigation related to pre-closing activities. As of December 31, 2018, the
carrying value of the indemnification obligation is immaterial and reflects an
estimate of liability; however, actual liabilities can potentially be higher
than amounts reserved. The amount of liability that we may ultimately incur
from indemnification claims may have an adverse impact, perhaps materially, on
our financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an
adverse impact on our operations.

We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and
examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the
businesses in which we may permissibly engage. The laws and regulations
governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our
depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund,
not our stockholders or other creditors. These laws and regulations govern a
variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control,
maintenance of adequate capital, and general business operations and financial
condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and
investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on
dividends, establishment of branch offices, and the maximum interest rate that
may be charged by law). Further, we must obtain approval from our regulators
before engaging in many activities, and our regulators have the ability to
compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can
be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek
will be obtained.

Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing
continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such
changes cannot be predicted. Changes to the legal and regulatory framework
governing our operations, including the passage and continued implementation
of the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA, have significantly revised the laws and
regulations under which we operate. Although EGRRCPA contained limited
amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and certain other post-financial crisis
regulatory requirements, rules to implement the changes have yet to be
finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the
regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain.
Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time, and new
legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions Bank and our
subsidiaries.

Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and
governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect
us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to
appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could
result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to
our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Our regulatory position is discussed in
greater detail in Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions"
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.

Regions and Regions Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and
types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators
implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity
guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be
restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited
from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing
or redeeming capital securities.

In particular, the capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines applicable to
Regions and Regions Bank under the currently applicable Basel III Rules
require Regions to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy and
liquidity standards than in the past. In addition, these requirements could
have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make
acquisitions and make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends
or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our

  

29

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

return on equity. In addition, Basel IV significantly revises the Basel
capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the manner in which the
revisions are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as Regions
and Regions Bank.

For more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity
requirements, see Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions"
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8\. of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Rulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory
and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.

Since its formation, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that
could have a significant impact on our business and the financial services
industry more generally. In particular, the CFPB has adopted rules impacting
nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage loan as
discussed in the "Supervision and Regulation" section of Item 1. "Business" of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K above. We may also be required to add
additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related
expenses. Our business, results of operations or competitive position may be
adversely affected as a result.

We may not be able to complete future acquisitions, may not be successful in
realizing the benefits of any future acquisitions that are completed, or may
choose not to pursue acquisition opportunities we might find beneficial.

We may, from time to time, evaluate and engage in the acquisition or
divestiture of businesses (including their assets or liabilities, such as
loans or deposits). We must generally satisfy a number of meaningful
conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including in certain
cases, federal and state bank regulatory approvals.

The process for obtaining required regulatory approvals, particularly for
large financial institutions, like Regions, can be difficult, time-consuming
and unpredictable. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and
competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability,
or our perceived inability, to obtain required regulatory approvals in a
timely manner or at all.

Assuming we are able to successfully complete one or more transactions, we may
not be able to successfully integrate and realize the expected synergies from
any completed transaction in a timely manner or at all. In particular, we may
be held responsible by federal and state regulators for regulatory and
compliance failures at an acquired business prior to the date of the
acquisition, and these failures by the acquired company may have negative
consequences for us, including the imposition of formal or informal
enforcement actions. Completion and integration of any transaction may also
divert management attention from other matters, result in additional costs and
expenses, or adversely affect our relationships with our customers and
employees, any of which may adversely affect our business or results of
operations. Future acquisitions may also result in dilution of our current
stockholders' ownership interests or may require we incur additional
indebtedness or use a substantial amount of our available cash and other
liquid assets. As a result, our financial condition may be affected, and we
may become more susceptible to economic conditions and competitive pressures.

Increases in FDIC insurance assessments may adversely affect our earnings.

Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we
are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control
the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. The
FDIC may require us to pay higher FDIC assessments than we currently do or may
charge additional special assessments or future prepayments if, for example,
there are financial institution failures in the future. Any increase in
deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. See the "Supervision and
Regulation-Deposit Insurance" discussion within Item 1. "Business" and the
"Non-Interest Expense" discussion within Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC's deposit
insurance assessments applicable to Regions Bank.

Unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses may adversely affect our
ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities.

The Federal Reserve conducts an annual stress analysis of Regions to evaluate
our ability to absorb losses in three economic and financial scenarios
generated by the Federal Reserve, including base, adverse and severely adverse
economic and financial scenarios (although, in light of EGRRCPA's eliminating
the statutory requirement for the adverse scenario, on January 8, 2019, the
Federal Reserve proposed amendments to its stress testing rules that would,
among other things, eliminate the adverse scenario). The rules also require us
to conduct our own semi-annual stress analysis to assess the potential impact
on Regions of the scenarios used as part of the Federal Reserve's annual
stress analysis. A summary of the results of certain aspects of the Federal
Reserve's annual stress analysis is released publicly and contains information
and results specific to BHCs. The rules also currently require us to disclose
publicly a summary of the results of our semi-annual stress analyses, and
Regions Bank's annual stress analyses, under the severely adverse scenario.

Although the stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition or
outlook, our customers may misinterpret and adversely react to the results of
these stress tests despite the strength of our financial condition. Any
potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to
attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business
opportunities.

The inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new
business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

Our regulators may also require us to raise additional capital or take other
actions, or may impose restrictions on our business, based on the results of
the stress tests, including rejecting, or requiring revisions to, our annual
capital plan submitted in connection with the CCAR. The failure of our capital
plan to pass the CCAR could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and
repurchase stock. In addition, we may not be able to raise additional capital
if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms that we believe are
advantageous to Regions or its current stockholders. Any such capital raises,
if required, may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Certain elements of these stress testing and capital planning requirements may
be eased in the future consistent with recently issued and anticipated
proposals by the Federal banking agencies following the enactment of EGRRCPA.
However, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and
therefore we expect to remain subject to these standards in the near term.

If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank
financial company were triggered, we could face assessments for the Orderly
Liquidation Fund.

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new mechanism, the OLA, for liquidation of
systemically important BHCs and non-bank financial companies. The OLA is
administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC's bank resolution model. The
Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority
only after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a
recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-
thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation
Fund, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based
assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be
made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would
have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if
necessary, on, among others, BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50
billion or more, such as Regions. Any such assessments may adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Capital Stock

The market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate.

The market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant
fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our
operations or business prospects. Such risks may be affected by:

|

Executive management changes.  
  
The market price of our capital stock, including our common stock and
depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock,
may be subject to fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or
prospects. Increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price
of our capital stock.

Our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.

Our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares
representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all
of Regions' existing and future indebtedness and Regions' other non-equity
claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us,
including claims in the event of our liquidation. As of December 31, 2018,
Regions' total liabilities were approximately $110.6 billion, and we may incur
additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources.
Additionally, if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of Regions
Bank falls below the required minimums, we or Regions

  

31

Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional
offerings of debt securities, including medium-term notes, senior or
subordinated notes or other applicable securities.

We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends,
distributions and other payments.

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other
subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay
dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding
debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory
limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as well as by
us to our stockholders. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State
of Alabama affect the ability of Regions Bank to pay dividends and other
distributions to us and to make loans to us. If Regions Bank is unable to make
dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise
available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and
preferred stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding
debt. See the "Stockholders' Equity" section of Item 7\. "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our right to participate in a
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is
subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the
extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be
recognized. As a result, shares of our capital stock are effectively
subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries' total deposits and
borrowings were approximately $107.3 billion.

We may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.

Holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such
dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such
payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common
stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common
stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock
prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our
capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or
acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends
on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend
period.

We are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to
pay dividends on our capital stock. For example, it is the policy of the
Federal Reserve that BHCs should generally pay dividends on common stock only
out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with
the organization's expected future needs, asset quality and financial
condition. Moreover, the Federal Reserve may closely scrutinize any dividend
payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income. Additionally, we are
currently required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve for
review before we can take certain capital actions, including declaring and
paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities. If our
capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any
reason, our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be
limited. Further, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements
applicable to us for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare
and pay dividends on our capital stock. Certain elements of these capital
planning requirements may be eased in the future consistent with recently
issued and anticipated proposals by the Federal banking agencies following the
enactment of EGRRCPA and the proposed Stress Capital Buffer framework.
However, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and
therefore we expect to remain subject to these standards in the near term.

Anti-takeover and banking laws and certain agreements and charter provisions
may adversely affect share value.

Certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of
incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us
without our Board's approval. Under federal law, subject to certain
exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies
before acquiring control of a BHC. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of
voting stock of a BHC or state member bank, including shares of our common
stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer "controls" the BHC
or state member bank. Also, as noted under the "Supervision and Regulation"
section of Item 1\. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a BHC must obtain the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring
direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares
of any bank, including Regions Bank. One factor the federal banking agencies
must consider in certain acquisitions is the systemic impact of the
transaction. This may make it more difficult for large institutions to acquire
other large institutions and may otherwise delay the regulatory approval
process, possibly by requiring public hearings. There also are provisions in
our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover
attempt. For example, holders of our preferred stock have certain voting
rights that could adversely affect share value. If and when dividends on the
preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly
dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the
authorized number of directors then constituting our Board will automatically
be increased by two, and the preferred stockholders will be entitled to elect
the two additional directors. Also, the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of the
preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-exchange or
reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or consolidation
of Regions with or into another entity, unless certain requirements are met.
These statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation,
including the rights of the holders of our preferred stock, could result in
Regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer.

We may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but may
be unable to do so.

We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with
sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and other
business purposes. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will
depend on, among other things, prevailing conditions in the capital markets,
which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. An economic
slowdown or loss of confidence in financial institutions could increase our
cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of
capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings
from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We cannot be assured that
capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence
that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the
confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Regions Bank or counterparties
participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt ratings, may
adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in
turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable
terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of
existing stockholders' equity ownership.

We may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to
raise additional capital, support growth, or to make acquisitions. Further, we
may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our
employees. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and
economic interests of our existing stockholders.

PART II

Item 5\. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Regions common stock, par value $.01 per share, is listed for trading on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RF. Information relating to
compensation plans under which Regions' equity securities are authorized for
issuance is presented in Part III, Item 12. As of February 20, 2019, there
were 41,998 holders of record of Regions common stock (including participants
in the Computershare Investment Plan for Regions Financial Corporation).

Restrictions on the ability of Regions Bank to transfer funds to Regions at
December 31, 2018, are set forth in Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements
and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements, which are included
in Item 8\. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of certain
limitations on the ability of Regions Bank to pay dividends to Regions and the
ability of Regions to pay dividends on its common stock is set forth in Item
1\. "Business" under the heading "Supervision and Regulation--Payment of
Dividends" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In connection with Regions' acquisition of BlackArch Partners LLC
("BlackArch") on October 20, 2015, Regions issued 831,766 shares of Regions
common stock to the former owners of BlackArch as partial consideration for
the acquisition. The shares issued in the transaction are exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2). Pursuant to contingent payment provisions in the purchase
agreement, if certain conditions are met, Regions will issue up to 1,528,234
additional shares of Regions common stock to the former owners of BlackArch
over the four-year period following the acquisition. During 2018 and 2017, an
additional 98,951 shares and 134,837 shares were issued, respectively, leaving
1,097,455 additional shares to be potentially issued. Each of the former
owners of BlackArch are accredited investors and no underwriters or placement
agents were involved in connection with issuance of Regions common stock.

Regions' Board authorized, effective June 28, 2018, a new $2.031 billion
common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the
third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. As of
December 31, 2018, Regions has repurchased approximately 90.4 million shares
of common stock at a total cost of $1.7 billion under this plan. The Company
also continued to repurchase shares on the open market under its capital plan
in the first quarter of 2019. As of February 21, 2019, Regions had repurchased
approximately 7.4 million additional shares of common stock at a total cost of
approximately $114.0 million. All of these shares were immediately retired
upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury stock.

Item 7\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of
the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial
aspects of Regions Financial Corporation's ("Regions" or "the Company")
business, particularly regarding its 2018 results. Cross references to more
detailed information regarding each topic within MD&A and the consolidated
financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in
understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with
the entire MD&A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other
sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2018 Results

Regions reported net income from continuing operations available to common
shareholders of $1.5 billion, or $1.36 per diluted share, in 2018 compared to
net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $1.2
billion, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2017.

Net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $3.8 billion in 2018 compared to $3.6 billion in 2017. The net
interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.50 percent in 2018,
reflecting an 18 basis point increase from 2017 primarily due to increases in
yields on earning assets, particularly loans, exceeding the increase in total
funding costs.

The provision for loan losses totaled $229 million in 2018 compared to $150
million in 2017. This increase was primarily a result of increased loan
balances and slowing credit improvement as compared to 2017. The increase was
partially offset by the release of the Company's $40 million hurricane-
specific loan loss allowance associated with certain 2017 hurricanes, as well
as a $16 million net reduction to the provision for loan losses in the first
quarter of 2018 associated with the sale of $254 million in residential first
mortgage loans consisting primarily of performing troubled debt restructured
loans. The provision for loan losses was less than net charge-offs by $94
million in 2018, which also included the impact of broad-based improvements in
non-performing and criticized loans. Net charge-offs were 0.40 percent of
average loans in 2018, compared to 0.38 percent in 2017.

Non-interest income from continuing operations was $2.0 billion in both 2018
and 2017. While total non-interest income from continuing operations was
consistent between years, there were increases in service charges on deposit
accounts, card and ATM fees, capital markets income, investment services fee
income, and other miscellaneous income. These increases were partially offset
by decreases in mortgage income and income from bank-owned life insurance,
lower net securities gains, and losses from market value adjustments on
employee benefit assets. See Table 5 "Non-Interest Income from Continuing
Operations" for further details.

Non-interest expense from continuing operations was $3.6 billion in 2018 and
$3.5 billion in 2017. The increase was driven primarily by increases in
salaries and employee benefits, outside services, professional, legal and
regulatory expenses, as well as a reduction in the credit for unfunded credit
losses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance
assessments, branch consolidation, property and equipment charges, and Visa
class B shares expense. See Table 6 "Non-Interest Expense from Continuing
Operations" for further details.

On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, Tax
Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from 35
percent to 21 percent. This was the primary contributor to reducing Regions'
effective tax rate from 33.3 percent in 2017 to 19.8 percent in 2018.

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018, and generated an after-
tax gain of $196 million. A discussion of activity within discontinued
operations is included at the end of "Operating Results" in the MD&A section
of this report.

Capital

Capital Actions

As part of its 2018 CCAR submission, Regions' proposed capital plan included
increasing its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.09 per share to $0.14
per share beginning in the third quarter of 2018 and the execution of up to
$2.031 billion in common share repurchases. The 2018 capital plan covers the
period from the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019. As
of December 31, 2018, Regions had repurchased approximately 90.4 million
shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately

$1.7 billion under this plan. The Federal Reserve did not object to the
capital plan. The Company continued to repurchase shares under this plan into
the first quarter of 2019.

Regulatory Capital

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the
Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank and, as
such, began transitioning to the Basel III Rules in January 2015 subject to a
phase-in period through January 2019, which has been extended. When fully
phased in, the Basel III Rules will increase capital requirements through
higher minimum capital levels as well as through increases in risk-weights for
certain exposures. Proposals from the federal banking agencies may revise the
capital treatment of certain assets and may extend the current transitional
treatment. The Basel III Rules maintained the minimum guidelines for Regions
to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0%
and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, Regions' Basel III Tier 1
capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 10.68% and 12.46%,
respectively.

The Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' Basel III CET1
ratio at December 31, 2018 was estimated to be 9.90%. Regions estimates its
fully phased-in CET1 ratio (non-GAAP) at December 31, 2018 to be 9.83%.

Loan Portfolio and Credit

During 2018, total loans increased by $3.2 billion or 4.0 percent compared to
2017. Loan balances increased year-over-year in all three portfolio segments.
The commercial portfolio segment increase was driven primarily by a $3.2
billion increase in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio class. The
growth in the commercial portfolio was broad-based, with the energy and
financial services portfolio classes experiencing the largest increases
compared to 2017. The investor real estate portfolio segment increase was
driven by a $588 million increase in commercial investor real estate mortgage
loans. This increase was the result of growth in term real estate lending, as
well as a reclassification in December 2018 of approximately $345 million of
senior housing loans into the investor real estate portfolio from the owner-
occupied commercial real estate mortgage portfolio. The $28 million increase
in the consumer portfolio segment was due primarily to increases in indirect-
other consumer loans due to continued growth in point-of-sale initiatives, as
well as growth in residential first mortgage loans. These increases were
partially offset by decreases in home equity loans as a result of continued
payoffs and paydowns and indirect-vehicle loans reflecting the termination of
a third-party arrangement in 2016.

The economy has been and will continue to be the primary factor which
influences Regions' loan portfolio. Improvement in overall economic conditions
continued in 2018, with demand for bank lending increasing during the second
half of the year. The economic growth trends resulted in higher market
interest rates during the year. These factors contributed to balance sheet
growth for Regions, and provided Regions' customers with the ability to
optimize liquidity through the use of cash for higher earning investment
opportunities. Labor market and housing market conditions continued to
progress at a steady pace over the course of 2018. Overall, current economic
momentum is expected to slow modestly in 2019. Management's expectation for
2019 adjusted average loan growth is in the low single digits consistent with
the GDP forecast.

Net charge-offs totaled $323 million, or 0.40 percent of average loans, in
2018, compared to $307 million, or 0.38 percent in 2017, reflecting some
large-dollar commercial loan charge-offs within the energy, healthcare and
restaurant, accommodation and lodging sectors, as well as an increase
associated with growth in indirect-other consumer loans. Total non-accrual
loans, past due loans, troubled debt restructurings, and criticized commercial
and investor real estate loans decreased year-over-year. The decrease was
driven primarily by payoffs and paydowns of criticized commercial loans, as
well as improved risk ratings in the commercial loan portfolio. The allowance
for loan losses was 1.01 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at
December 31, 2018, a decrease from 1.17 percent at December 31, 2017. The
coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 169%
at December 31, 2018, compared to 144% at December 31, 2017.

Liquidity

At the end of 2018, Regions Bank had $1.5 billion in cash on deposit with the
Federal Reserve and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 88 percent. Cash and cash
equivalents at the parent company totaled $1.9 billion. Regions' liquidity
policy related to minimum holding company cash requires the holding company to
maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service
and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million.

At December 31, 2018, the Company's borrowing capacity with the Federal
Reserve was $19.0 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing
availability with the FHLB was $8.7 billion based on available collateral at
the same date. The Company has approximately $16.6 billion of unencumbered
liquid securities available for pledging. Regions also maintains a shelf
registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
can be utilized by the Company to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $5
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time.

A minimum LCR requirement exists for certain large BHCs, savings and loan
holding companies and depository institutions, and a less stringent LCR
requirement (the "modified LCR") exists for other banking organizations, such
as Regions, with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The
regulatory agencies finalized a rule that requires quarterly public
disclosures of certain LCR measures beginning with results from the fourth
quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company was fully compliant with
the LCR requirements.

GENERAL

The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in
understanding Regions' financial position and results of operations. The
emphasis of this discussion will be on continuing operations for the years
2018, 2017 and 2016; in addition, financial information for prior years will
also be presented when appropriate.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and
other financing income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest
income and other financing income

  

39

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on
interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest
expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and
borrowings. Regions' net interest income and other financing income is
impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest
rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its
liabilities. Net interest income and other financing income also includes
rental income and depreciation expense associated with operating leases for
which Regions is the lessor. Non-interest income includes fees from service
charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non-interest
expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional,
legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments and other operating
expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a
competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service
and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient
locations.

Recent Acquisitions

On October 17, 2016, Regions announced the acquisition of the low income
housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses
of First Sterling Financial, Inc., which is one of the leading national
syndicators of investment funds benefiting from low income housing tax
credits. The acquisition complements Regions' existing low income housing tax
credit origination business and further expands the Company's capabilities to
serve more clients and communities.

Dispositions

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. The gain associated
with the transaction amounted to $281 million ($196 million after-tax).

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on
April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not
included in the sale; they are included in the Wealth Management segment.

Results of operations for the entities sold are presented separately as
discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated
statements of income. Other expenses related to the transaction are also
included in discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3 "Discontinued Operations"
and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees" to the consolidated
financial statements for further details.

Business Segments

Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services,
as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth
management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions
carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other.

See Note 23 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial
statements for further information on Regions' business segments.

________

N/A - not applicable.

(1) Due to the immaterial impact of the discontinued operations, the balance
sheet has not been presented on a continuing operations basis.

(2) See Table 2 for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

(3) The 2018 return on average common stockholders' equity, return on average
tangible stockholders' equity and return on average assets were 11.64%,
17.57%, and 1.43%, respectively, including discontinued operations.

(4) Regions' regulatory capital ratios for years prior to 2015 have not been
revised to reflect the retrospective application of new accounting guidance
related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects.

(5) Current year Basel III common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, Total
capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

(6) Beginning in 2015, Regions' regulatory capital ratios are calculated
pursuant to the phase-in provisions of the Basel III Rules. All prior period
ratios were calculated pursuant to the Basel I capital rules.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average total loans", "adjusted net interest
margin", "adjusted efficiency ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio", "return on
average tangible common stockholders' equity", on a consolidated and
continuing operations basis, and end of period "tangible common stockholders'
equity", and "Basel III CET1, on a fully phased-in basis" and related ratios.
Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures
excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for period-to-
period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in
analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to
assess the performance of Regions' business because management does not
consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of
ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP
financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the
Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the
Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentations to investors of Company performance

Total average loans is presented excluding the impact of the first quarter
2018 residential first mortgage loan sale and the indirect vehicles third-
party exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP).
Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a meaningful
calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that
applied by management.

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis
(GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments related to Tax Reform to
arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income on a
taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). Net interest income and other financing
income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added
together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments
are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis
(non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted
fee income ratios.

Tangible common stockholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal
banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions'
capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders' equity measure.
Because tangible common stockholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP,
this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other
entities may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations.
Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy
using tangible common stockholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful
to provide investors the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this
same basis.

The Basel Committee's Basel III framework will strengthen international
capital and liquidity regulations. When fully phased in, Basel III will
increase capital requirements through higher minimum capital levels as well as
through increases in risk-weights for certain exposures. Additionally, the
Basel III Rules place greater emphasis on common equity. The Federal Reserve
released its final Basel III Rules detailing the U.S. implementation of Basel
III in 2013. Regions, as a standardized approach bank, began transitioning to
the Basel III framework in January 2015 subject to a phase-in period extending
through January 2019. Because the Basel III implementation regulations will
not be fully phased in until 2019 and, are not formally defined by GAAP, these
measures are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and
banking regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy using the fully
phased-in Basel III framework, Regions believes that it is useful to provide
investors information enabling them to assess Regions' capital adequacy on the
same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans to
adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of net income
(GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders (GAAP) to net
income available to common shareholders from continuing operations (GAAP) 4) a
reconciliation of non-interest expense from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest expense from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 5) a
reconciliation of net interest income and other financing income/margin,
taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest income and other
financing income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 6) a
reconciliation of non-interest income from continuing operations (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 7) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), 10) a reconciliation of average and ending
stockholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
stockholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP),
11) a reconciliation of stockholders' equity (GAAP) to Basel III CET1, on a
fully phased-in basis (non-GAAP), and 12) calculation of the related ratio
based on Regions' current understanding of the Basel III requirements (non-
GAAP).

Regions has systems and internal controls in place to calculate risk-weighted

the requirements.  
  
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting
principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles
conform with GAAP, regulatory guidances, where applicable, and general banking
practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related
primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements,
intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets),
residential MSRs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.
Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial
guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The allowance represents
management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and
credit commitment portfolios as of period end. Regions determines its
allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance.

For non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans equal to or greater
than $2.5 million, the allowance for loan losses is based on note-level
evaluation considering the facts and circumstances specific to each borrower.
For all other commercial and investor real estate loans, the allowance for
loan losses is based on statistical models using a PD and an LGD. Historical
default information for similar loans is used as an input for the statistical
model.

For residential first mortgages, home equity lending and other consumer-
related loans, individual products are reviewed on a group basis (e.g.,
residential first mortgage pools). Historical loss information for similar
loans is used as an input for the models.

Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance
include, but are not limited to: 1) detailed reviews of individual loans; 2)
historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge-offs for the
various classes of loans evaluated; 3) the Company's policies relating to
delinquent loans and charge-offs; 4) the level of the allowance in relation to
total loans and to historical loss levels; 5) levels and trends in non-
performing, criticized, classified and past due loans; 6) collateral values of
properties securing loans; 7) the composition of the loan portfolio, including
unfunded credit commitments; 8) management's analysis of current economic
conditions; and 9) migration of loans between risk rating categories.

In support of collateral values, Regions obtains updated valuations for large
commercial and investor real estate non-performing loans on at least an annual
basis. For loans that are individually identified for impairment, those
valuations are currently discounted as appropriate from the most recent
appraisal to consider continued declines in values. The discounted valuations
are utilized in the measurement of the level of impairment in the allowance
calculation. For loans that are not individually identified for impairment and
secured by collateral, Regions considers the impact of declines in valuations
in the loss given default estimates within the allowance calculation.

The allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. As a matter of business practice,
Regions may require some form of credit support, such as a guarantee.
Guarantees are legally binding and entered into simultaneously with the
primary loan agreements. Evaluation of guarantors' ability and willingness to
pay is considered as part of the risk rating process, which provides the basis
for the allowance for loan losses for the commercial and investor real estate
portfolios. In concluding that the risk rating is

  

46

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

appropriate, Regions considers a number of factors including whether
underlying cash flow is adequate to service the debt, payment history, and
whether there is appropriate guarantor support. Accordingly, Regions has
concluded that the impact of credit support provided by guarantors has been
appropriately considered in the calculation and assessment of the allowance
for loan losses.

The allowance is also sensitive to a variety of external factors, such as the
general health of the economy, as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices,
changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates,
bankruptcy filings, fluctuations in the GDP, and the effects of weather and
natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

Management considers the current level of the allowance appropriate to absorb
losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Management's
determination of the appropriateness of the allowance requires the use of
judgments and estimations that may change in the future. Changes in the
factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance
or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be
increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory
agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the
level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in
certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in
circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may
result in volatility.

Management's estimate of the allowance for the commercial and investor real
estate portfolio segments could be affected by estimates of losses inherent in
various product types as a result of fluctuations in the internal and external
factors mentioned above. For pooled commercial and investor real estate
accounts, a 5 percent increase in the PD for non-defaulted accounts and a 5
percent increase in the LGD for all accounts would result in an increase to
estimated inherent losses of approximately $35 million.

Losses on residential real estate mortgages, home equity lending and other
consumer-related loans can be affected by such factors as collateral value,
loss severity, and other internal and external factors mentioned above. A 5
percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these loans would
change estimated inherent losses by approximately $11 million.

These pro forma analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance to key
assumptions; however, they do not reflect an expected outcome.

For further discussion of the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses"
to the consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements

A portion of the Company's assets and liabilities is carried at fair value,
with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale,
mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily
determinable market values), residential MSRs and derivative assets and
liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects
other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such
as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower
of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated
costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate
is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market
information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value
are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific
properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts
certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair
value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.

Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price
that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability
(an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses
judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would
transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of
activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity,
management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair
value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party
investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the
asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value
estimates.

A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about
the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a
restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance.
Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair
value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities
traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not
available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where
observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from
model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the
market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations).
These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates for
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models,
discounted cash flow

  

47

models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices
of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset
or liability.

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value,
including pricing validation processes.

Intangible Assets

Regions' intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the
fair value of net assets of acquired businesses ("goodwill") and other
identifiable intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles and
purchased credit card relationships). Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion and $4.9
billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Goodwill is allocated to
each of Regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank,
Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management). The decline in the goodwill balance in
2018 is due to the sale of Regions Insurance Group within the Wealth
Management reportable segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual
basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate
impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).

Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to
determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the evidence, the
Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book
value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to
bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than
not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a two-step goodwill
impairment test is performed. In Step One, the fair value of the reporting
unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. To the extent
that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying
value, impairment is not indicated and no further testing is required.
Conversely, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below its
carrying amount, Step Two must be performed. Step Two consists of determining
the implied estimated fair value of goodwill, which is the net difference
between the valuation adjustments of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill
and the valuation adjustment to equity (from Step One) of the reporting unit.
The carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an
allocation based upon risk weighted assets. Adverse changes in the economic
environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors
could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill. If
the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount,
a loss (which could be material) would be recognized to reduce the carrying
amount to the estimated implied fair value.

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1,
2018, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit
level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing
the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances
since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including
reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory
actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific
factors, and trends in the banking industry. After assessing the totality of
the events and circumstances, the Company determined that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. Therefore,
Step One and Step Two of the goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary.
Refer to Note 10 "Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements
for additional discussion of goodwill.

Specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could
negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment
include: a protracted decline in the Company's market capitalization; adverse
business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher
loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum
regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to Note 14
"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory
requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those
resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act); and/or a significant protraction in the
current level of interest rates.

Other material identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit
intangibles and purchased credit card relationships, are reviewed at least
annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which
could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could
include loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit card accounts
and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To
the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an
impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events
or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions' operating
results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be
reasonably estimated.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights

Regions has elected to measure and report its residential MSRs using the fair
value method. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do
not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the
exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are
therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed
in the "Fair Value Measurements" section. Specific characteristics of the
underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential
MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing
portfolio on the basis of certain risk

  

48

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its
residential MSRs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These
techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing
cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential
mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing
costs. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact
the fair value of residential MSRs which impacts earnings. The carrying value
of residential MSRs was $418 million at December 31, 2018. Based on a
hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions estimates that a reduction in
primary mortgage market rates of 25 basis points and 50 basis points would
reduce the December 31, 2018 fair value of residential MSRs by approximately 4
percent ($17 million) and 8 percent ($35 million), respectively. Conversely,
25 basis point and 50 basis point increases in these rates would increase the
December 31, 2018 fair value of residential MSRs by approximately 4 percent
($15 million) and 7 percent ($29 million), respectively. Regions also
estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately $10 per loan,
or 12 percent, would result in a decline in the value of the residential MSRs
by approximately $12 million.

The pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity
of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates. This
sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome. Refer to the
"Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights" discussion in the "Balance Sheet"
analysis section found later in this report.

Income Taxes

Accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or
other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and
reflect management's estimate of income taxes to be paid or received.

Deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid
or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method. The
net balance is reported as a component of either other assets or other
liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company
determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive
and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating
results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable
income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax
planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes
forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated book-tax differences
and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to
taxing jurisdictions. These assumptions require significant judgment and are
consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the
underlying businesses. The realization of the deferred tax assets could be
reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than
forecasted. For a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets,
refer to the "Income Taxes" section found later in this report.

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local
jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be
interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in a range
of outcomes. Thus, the Company is required to exercise judgment regarding the
application of these tax laws and regulations. The Company will evaluate and
recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties. Due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result
in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax
liabilities.

The Company's estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and
income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new
legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes
in income tax rates. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the
Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1,
2018, Tax Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax
rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the
consolidated financial statements for further details.

OPERATING RESULTS

NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER FINANCING INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN

Net interest income and other financing income is Regions' principal source of
income and is one of the most important elements of Regions' ability to meet
its overall performance goals. Net interest income and other financing income
(taxable-equivalent basis) increased approximately $157 million, or 4 percent
in 2018 compared to 2017, due to the increases in yields on earning assets,
particularly loans, exceeding the increase in total funding costs. In 2018,
net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis) was
reduced by the passage of Tax Reform from the resulting impact on the yield
adjustment for tax advantaged assets.

The net interest margin increased to 3.50 percent in 2018 from 3.32 percent in
2017, due to an increase in yields on earning assets exceeding an increase in
total funding costs during 2018. Comparing 2018 to 2017, average earning asset
yields were 39 basis points higher. Also, interest-bearing liability rates
were higher, increasing by 32 basis points. As a result, the net interest rate
spread increased 7 basis points to 3.18 percent in 2018 compared to 3.11
percent in 2017.

The Federal Reserve continued its gradual reduction in the amount of policy
accommodation throughout 2018. This, coupled with improving global economic
growth trends, resulted in increases in both short-term and long-term interest
rates in 2018. Long-term interest rates are generally represented by the yield
on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The average yield on the
benchmark rate increased to 2.91 percent in 2018, as compared to 2.33 percent
in 2017. The taxable investment securities portfolio, which contains
significant residential fixed-rate exposure, increased in yield to 2.58
percent in 2018 from 2.39 percent in 2017,

  

49

largely attributable to higher interest rates and their positive impact on
both security reinvestment yields and reduced premium amortization. Similarly,
higher long-term rates have benefited the yield on fixed rate loans through
reinvestment under normal business activity. Fixed rate loan and security
reinvestment were both accretive to yields at year-end market rate levels, as
the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ended 2018 at 2.68 percent. The Company's loan
pricing is also influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day LIBOR.
As the Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates in 2017, as well as
in March, June, September and December 2018, 30-day LIBOR averaged 2.02
percent in 2018, compared to 1.11 percent in 2017, leading to higher loan
yields.

The composition of Regions' funding base and prudent management resulted in
funding costs increasing at a slower pace than earning asset yields as the Fed
Funds rate increased throughout 2018. Deposit costs increased to 26 basis
points for 2018 compared to 16 basis points for 2017. Average long-term
borrowing balances increased to $10.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $7.1
billion in 2017. The cost on these borrowings increased 21 basis points, as
the majority of Regions' long-term debt is effectively converted to floating
rate debt through the execution of interest rate swaps. Shorter-term FHLB
advances also repriced higher in 2018 as the majority of the these borrowings
are floating rate debt as well. See the "Long-Term Borrowings" section in
Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

See also the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" section in Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information.

|

The change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been
allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the
relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income and other financing
income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for December
31, 2018 and 35% for both December 31, 2017 and 2016, adjusted for applicable
state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.  
  
The mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions'
primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain
types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for
example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as
securities, Federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreements to
resell. The spread on loans increased in 2018 as compared to 2017, due
primarily to the increase in market interest rates. Average earning assets in
2018 totaled $108.2 billion, a decrease of $983 million as compared to the
prior year.

Average loans as a percentage of average earning assets was 75 percent and 73
percent in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The remaining categories of earning
assets are shown in Table 3 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and
Yield/Rate Analysis". The proportion of average earning assets to average
total assets, which was 88 percent in both 2018 and 2017, measures the
effectiveness of management's efforts to invest available funds into the most
profitable earning vehicles. Funding for Regions' earning assets comes from
interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. Another significant factor
affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded
by interest-bearing liabilities. The percentage of average earning assets
funded by average interest-bearing liabilities was 65 percent in 2018 and 63
percent in 2017.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan
losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb
probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. During
2018, the provision for loan losses totaled $229 million and net charge-offs
were $323 million. This compares to a provision for loan losses of $150
million and net charge-offs of $307 million in 2017. The increase in the
provision for loan losses was primarily a result of increased loan balances
and slowing credit improvement as compared to 2017. The increase was partially
offset by the release of the Company's $40 million hurricane-specific loan
loss allowance associated with certain 2017 hurricanes, as well as a $16
million net reduction to the provision for loan losses in the first quarter of
2018 from the sale of $254 million in residential first mortgage loans
consisting primarily of performing troubled debt restructured loans.

For further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses,
see the "Allowance for Credit Losses" and "Risk Management" sections found
later in this report. See also Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the
consolidated financial statements.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund fees and other
service charges. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to
continued customer account growth and increases in non-sufficient fund fee
activity.

Card and ATM Fees

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income
and debit card and ATM related revenue. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017
was primarily the result of an increase in commercial and consumer checkcard
interchange income associated with new account growth and increases in spend
and transactions.

Capital Markets Income

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that
includes securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and
placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition
and other advisory services. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven
primarily by increases in income from mergers and acquisitions advisory fees,
customer interest rate swap income, and loan syndication fees, partially
offset by a decrease in fees from the placement of permanent financing for
real estate customers.

Mortgage Income

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of
residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage income during
2018 compared to 2017 was due to lower production, tighter margins and a
reduction in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedges.
The decreases were partially offset by increases in mortgage servicing income
as a result of purchasing the rights to service a total of approximately $6.1
billion in residential mortgage loans during 2018. See Note 7 "Servicing of
Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for more
information.

Investment Services Fee Income

Investment services fee income represents income earned through investment
advisory services, the primary revenue streams of which include sales of
annuity and brokerage products. The increase in investment services fees
during 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by improved productivity as
the result of hiring additional financial advisors.

Bank-owned Life Insurance

Bank-owned life insurance decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to
reduced claims benefits throughout the year, as well as valuation declines in
the fourth quarter of 2018 related to market volatility.

Securities Gains, net

Net securities gains primarily result from the Company's asset/liability
management process and the sale of certain securities held for employee
benefit purposes. See Note 4 "Securities" to the consolidated financial
statements for more information.

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and
other, are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held
for certain employee benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit
assets - other are offset in salaries and benefits expense.

Other Miscellaneous Income

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing,
valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes,
check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing
includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in 2018 compared to
2017 primarily due to net gains associated with the sale of certain low income
housing tax credit investments, increases in the value of equity investments,
and decreases in net impairment charges related to certain operating lease
assets.

Salaries and Employee Benefits

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation,
long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as
401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as,
expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and
employee benefits increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to
higher severance charges, annual merit increases, and higher production-based
incentive expenses, partially offset by staffing reductions and decreased
expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes and long-term
incentives. Severance charges totaled $61 million for 2018 compared to $10
million for 2017. Full-time equivalent headcount from continuing operations
decreased to 19,969 at December 31, 2018 from 21,014 at December 31, 2017,
reflecting the impact of the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as
part of its strategic priorities.

Outside Services

Outside services consists of expenses related to routine services provided by
third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs, data processing, loan
pricing and research, data license purchases, data subscriptions, and check
printing. Outside services increased during 2018 compared 2017 primarily due
to increased servicing costs related to point-of-sale lending through third
parties and additional expenses recorded related to a new Wealth Management
platform.

Professional, Legal and Regulatory Expenses

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to
legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges.
Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased during 2018 compared to
2017 primarily due to higher consulting fees related to implementation of
strategic priorities and litigation-related costs.

FDIC Insurance Assessments

FDIC insurance assessments decreased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily
due to the fourth quarter 2018 discontinuation of the FDIC assessment
surcharge that was implemented during the third quarter of 2016 and was in
place throughout the first nine months of 2018. Other factors that contributed
to the decrease included improved operating results, sale of troubled debt
restructured loans during the first quarter of 2018, and issuances of
unsecured senior bank notes during 2018.

Branch Consolidation, Property and Equipment Charges

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation
adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made.
Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased
branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy
optimization initiatives.

Visa Class B Shares Expense

Visa class B shares expense is associated with shares sold in a prior year.
The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to finalization of certain
covered litigation. Visa class B shares expense decreased during 2018 compared
to 2017 as a result of the changes in Visa's stock price and in the status of
the covered litigation.

Provision (Credit) for Unfunded Credit Losses

Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses is the adjustment to the reserve
for unfunded credit commitments, which can fluctuate based on the amount of
outstanding commitments and the level of risk associated with those
commitments. A provision for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to
increased volume and/or increased levels of estimated risk in commitments,
while a (credit) for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to reduced volume
and/or levels of estimated risk in commitments.

Other Miscellaneous Expenses

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications,
postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses,
mortgage repurchase costs and other costs (benefits) related to employee
benefit plans. While other miscellaneous expenses were consistent year over
year, there were some offsetting changes. The Company contributed $60 million
in 2018 and $40 million in 2017 to the Regions Financial Corporation
Foundation, resulting in an increase of $20 million in other miscellaneous
expenses. Additionally, other net periodic pension costs decreased in 2018 as
compared to 2017, which caused a decrease of approximately $24 million in
other miscellaneous expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended
2018 was $387 million compared to income tax expense of $619 million for the
same period in 2017, resulting in effective tax rates of 19.8 percent and 33.3
percent, respectively. The effective tax rate is lower in the current period
principally due to Tax Reform enacted in December 2017 that reduced the
federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1,
2018.

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the
level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions
with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing
investments, bank-owned life

  

55

* * *

  

insurance, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the
effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but
are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain
leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and
changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the
effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

At December 31, 2018, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $20
million compared to a net deferred asset of $163 million at December 31, 2017.
The decrease in the deferred tax asset is due principally to increases in
deferred tax liabilities related to employee benefits, fixed assets and lease
financing which was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets
related to unrealized losses on securities available for sale and derivative
instruments.

The Company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets
based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and
negative evidence. As part of this evaluative process, the Company considers
the following sources of taxable income: 1) the future reversals of taxable
temporary differences; 2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing
temporary differences and carryforwards; and 3) tax-planning strategies. In
making a conclusion, the Company has evaluated all available positive and
negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income. The primary
sources of evidence impacting the Company's judgment regarding the realization
of its deferred tax assets are summarized below.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

History of earnings - In 2018, the Company has continued its positive earnings
trend with positive earnings from 2012 through 2018. There is no history of
significant tax carryforwards expiring unused.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Reversals of taxable temporary differences - The Company anticipates that
future reversals of taxable temporary differences, including the accretion of
taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in a prior
business combination, can absorb up to approximately $593 million of deferred
tax assets.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Creation of future taxable income - The Company has projected future taxable
income that will be sufficient to absorb the remaining deferred tax assets
after the reversal of future taxable temporary differences.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Ability to implement tax planning strategies - The Company has the ability to
implement tax planning strategies such as asset sales to maximize the
realization of deferred tax assets.  
  
Based on this evaluative process, the Company has established a valuation
allowance in the amount of $30 million at December 31, 2018 and $34 million at
December 31, 2017 because the Company believes that a portion of state net
operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized. See Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information about income
taxes.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. On April 2, 2012,
Morgan Keegan was sold. Results from both Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and
affiliates and Morgan Keegan are included in discontinued operations.

Regions' results from discontinued operations are presented in Note 3
"Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements. Income
from discontinued operations in 2018 included the gain associated with the
sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and affiliates of $281 million ($196
million after tax). Income from discontinued operations in 2017 was primarily
the result of recoveries of legal expenses.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and equity categories.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

At December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.5 billion as
compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease year-over-year was
due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit with the FRB, as the result of
normal day-to-day operating variations.

Debt Securities

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company.

The "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity Risk" sections, found
later in this report, further explain Regions' interest rate and liquidity
risk management practices. The weighted-average yield earned on debt
securities was 2.58 percent in 2018 and 2.45 percent in 2017 (see Table 8
"Relative Contractual Maturities and Weighted-Average Yields for Debt
Securities"). Table 7 "Debt Securities" details the carrying values of debt
securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity.

The weighted-average yields are calculated on the basis of the yield to
maturity based on the book value of each debt security. Weighted-average
yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a taxable-equivalent
basis using a tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net
of the related federal tax benefit. Average tax-exempt securities were
maintained at such a small balance in 2018 that the taxable-equivalent
adjustments for the calculation of yields amounted to zero for the year ended
December 31, 2018. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have not been adjusted for
the non-deductible portion of interest expense used to finance the purchase of
tax-exempt obligations.  
  
Portfolio Quality--Regions' investment policy emphasizes credit quality and
liquidity. Debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally
recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S. Government
and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis,
represented approximately 95 percent of the investment portfolio at December
31, 2018. All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S.
Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated
represented approximately 5 percent of total debt securities at December 31,
2018.

Loans

GENERAL

Average loans, net of unearned income, represented 75 percent of average
interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 73
percent for the year ended December 31, 2017. Lending at Regions is generally
organized along three portfolio segments: commercial loans (including
commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage
and construction loans), investor real estate loans (commercial real estate
mortgage and construction loans) and consumer loans (residential first
mortgage, home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer
credit card and other consumer loans).

Table 9 illustrates a year-over-year comparison of loans, net of unearned
income, by portfolio segment and class and Table 10 provides information on
selected loan maturities.

(1) Excludes consumer portfolio segment.

(2) Excludes $225 million of small business credit card accounts.

Loans, net of unearned income, totaled $83.2 billion at December 31, 2018, an
increase of $3.2 billion from year-end 2017 levels. Regions manages loan
growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital.
Loan balances increased year over year in all 3 portfolio segments. However,
within the commercial portfolio segment, the commercial real estate mortgage
owner-occupied class declined year over year. In addition, within the consumer
portfolio segment, the home equity and indirect-vehicles classes declined year
over year.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from the 2017 year-
end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its
loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography
throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to
certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual
borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types
of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See
Note 5 "Loans" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional discussion.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $3.2 billion or 9 percent since year-end 2017
driven primarily by new relationships and expansion of existing relationships
within the Company's corporate and middle market portfolios aided by growth
within specialized lending groups, which offset the impact of large corporate
customers utilizing the fixed income market to pay down and pay off bank debt.
Also contributing to the increase was a reclassification of approximately $263
million in purchasing card balances previously recognized in other assets. The
commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. These loans declined $644 million or 10 percent from
year-end 2017, and included a reclassification in December 2018 of
approximately $345 million of senior housing loans out of owner-occupied
commercial real estate mortgage loans and into the investor real estate
portfolio. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made
to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted.  
  
Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $602 million in comparison to 2017 year-
end balances due to growth in term real estate lending, as well as a
reclassification in December 2018 of approximately $345 million of senior
housing loans into the commercial investor real estate mortgage portfolio
class from the owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage portfolio class.
Due to the nature of the cash flows typically used to repay investor real
estate loans, these loans are particularly vulnerable to weak economic
conditions.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $215 million in comparison to 2017 year-end balances.
This increase was net of the sale of $254 million of primarily performing
troubled debt restructured loans and certain non-restructured interest-only
loans during the first quarter of 2018. Approximately $2.6 billion in new loan
originations were retained on the balance sheet during 2018.

Home Equity

Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This
type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their
homes. The home equity portfolio totaled $9.3 billion at December 31, 2018 as
compared to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The decline in the home equity
portfolio year-over-year was due to continued payoffs and paydowns.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of
December 31, 2018. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines
with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert
to a repayment period.

Of the $9.3 billion home equity portfolio at December 31, 2018, approximately
$5.9 billion were home equity lines of credit and $3.4 billion were closed-end
home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Beginning in
December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and
a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have
an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009
to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a
10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a
20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw
period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term "balloon payment" means
there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for
interest-only lines of credit.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property pledged as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates home price trends for MSAs.
Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's
footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios
taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio
segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due
to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the
entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance
exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the
"Above 100%" category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to
partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect--Vehicles

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $273 million from year-end 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to the termination of a third-party arrangement
during the fourth quarter of 2016. The balance is expected to continue to
decrease.

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending
business due to competition-based margin compression impacting overall returns
on the portfolio. Regions will cease originating new indirect auto loans in
the first quarter of 2019 and intends to complete any in-process indirect auto
loan closings by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will
remain in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point-of-sale lending through
third parties. This portfolio class increased $882 million from year-end 2017
primarily due to continued growth in existing point-of-sale initiatives.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances increased $55 million from
year-end 2017.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $56 million from year-
end 2017.

Regions qualitatively considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO
scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators
for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. The
following tables present estimated current FICO score data for components of
classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current FICO data is not available
for the remaining loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if
customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available.
Residential first mortgage and home equity balances with FICO scores below 620
were 5 percent of the combined portfolios for both December 31, 2018 and
December 31, 2017.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The
allowance for loan losses totaled $840 million at December 31, 2018 compared
to $934 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a
percentage of net loans decreased from 1.17 percent at December 31, 2017 to
1.01 percent as of December 31, 2018. The decrease in percentage is
attributable to reductions in non-performing, criticized and TDR loans.

The provision for loan losses increased from $150 million in 2017 to $229
million in 2018 primarily as a result of increased loan balances and slowing
credit improvement compared to 2017. The provision for loan losses was less
than net charge-offs for 2018 by approximately $94 million, as a result of
broad-based improvements in non-performing and criticized loans. Net charge-
offs for 2018 were approximately $16 million higher as compared to 2017,
reflecting an increase associated with growth in the indirect - other consumer
loans and higher recoveries on commercial investor real estate mortgage loans
in 2017. Additionally, lower than anticipated losses associated with certain
2017 hurricanes resulted in the release of the Company's $40 million
hurricane-specific loan loss allowance during 2018. Lastly, a $16 million net
reduction to the provision for loan losses from the first quarter of 2018 sale
of $254 million in residential first mortgage loans consisting primarily of
performing troubled debt restructured loans also contributed to the results.

Management expects that net loan charge-offs will be in the 0.40 percent to
0.50 percent range for the 2019 year; based on recent trends and current
market conditions. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment,
volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the
future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility in certain
credit metrics. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually
large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility.

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from previous years' totals, are included in Table 15 "Allowance for
Credit Losses."

Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the pending
accounting pronouncement that will replace the current incurred loss
accounting model for the allowance for credit losses with a current expected
credit loss approach (CECL), which will be effective for Regions on January 1,
2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity,
consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under
the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the
result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were
offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and
investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in
interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below
market. More detailed information is included in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit
Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table
summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-
accruing TDRs for the periods ending December 31:

Note: All loans listed in the table above are considered impaired under
applicable accounting literature.

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR inflows in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to inflows from
CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types
of concessions currently being granted under the CAP, as detailed in Note 6
"Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements,
Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely
achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to
continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

The majority of this category consists of payments and sales. "Other" outflows
include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans
transferred to held for sale. It also includes $31 million of commercial loans
and $35 million of investor real estate loans refinanced or restructured as
new loans and removed from TDR classification during 2018. During 2017, $63
million of commercial loans and $10 million of investor real estate loans were
refinanced or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification.

Non-performing loans decreased during 2018 due to continued broad-based
improvement in credit quality. Total commercial and investor real estate non-
performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, that were paying as agreed
(e.g., less than 30 days past due) represented approximately 48% percent of
the total balance at December 31, 2018.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, excluding government
guaranteed loans, were $143 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease from $167
million at December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2018, Regions had approximately $75 million to $135 million of
potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not
included in non-accrual loans, but for which management had concerns as to the
ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms.
This is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate
loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next
quarter.

In order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans, credit
personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be
downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending on the occurrence of
future events. These personnel consider a variety of factors, including the
borrower's capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms,
make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary,
and provide current and complete financial information including global cash
flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. Based upon the
consideration of these factors, a probability weighting is assigned to loans
to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans
during this specific time period. Additionally, for other loans (for example,
smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the
estimate of potential future downgrades. Because of the inherent uncertainty
in forecasting future events, the estimate of potential problem loans
ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as
opposed to an individual listing of loans.

The majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is
based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for
substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are
included in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial
statements.

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans
held for sale) by portfolio segment:

Transfers to held for sale are shown net of charge-offs of $12 million and $19
million recorded upon transfer for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.  
  
Other Earning Assets

Other earning assets consist primarily of FRB and FHLB stock, marketable
equity securities and operating lease assets . The balance at December 31,
2018 totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer
to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $4.9 billion at
December 31, 2017. The decline in goodwill is due to the sale of Regions
Insurance Group, Inc. within the Wealth Management reportable segment. See
Note 3 for more information related to this transaction. Refer to the
"Critical Accounting Policies" section earlier in this report for detailed
discussions of the Company's methodology for testing goodwill for impairment.
Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 10
"Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for the
methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights at Fair Value

Residential MSRs increased approximately $82 million from December 31, 2017 to
December 31, 2018. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to purchases
of the rights to service approximately $6.1 billion in residential mortgage
loans for approximately $77 million, combined with additions resulting from
loans sold during the year with Regions retaining the servicing rights. These
total additions were partially offset by the economic amortization associated
with borrower repayments. An analysis of residential MSRs is presented in Note
7 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements.

Deposits

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions
also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking
services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet
banking.

Deposits are Regions' primary source of funds, providing funding for 87
percent of average earning assets in 2018 and 89 percent of average earning
assets in 2017. Table 21 "Deposits" details year-over-year deposits on a
period-ending basis. Total deposits at December 31, 2018 decreased
approximately $2.4 billion compared to year-end 2017 levels. The decrease in
deposits was primarily driven by decreases in money market accounts, non-
interest-bearing demand accounts, and interest-bearing transaction accounts.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in savings accounts and
time deposits.

Deposit costs have increased to 26 basis points for 2018, compared to 16 basis
points for 2017 and 12 basis points for 2016 due to a continuation of interest
rate increases, and in particular, increases in the Federal Funds target range
in 2018. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.42 percent
in 2018 compared to 0.26 percent for 2017 and 0.19 percent for 2016. Low
deposit costs are driven primarily by the composition of the Company's deposit
base, which includes a significant amount of low-cost, and relatively small
account balance consumer and private wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits are
also heavily concentrated in non-interest bearing demand deposits. The deposit
base composition is a key component of the Company's franchise value and is
expected to be a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment.

Non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $1.1 billion to $35.1 billion
at year-end 2018 due primarily to commercial customers using liquidity to pay
down debt or invest in their businesses. Non-interest-bearing deposits
accounted for approximately 37 percent of total deposits at both year-end 2018
and 2017.

Savings balances increased $375 million to $8.8 billion, generally reflecting
continued consumer savings trends.

Interest-bearing transaction accounts decreased $986 million to $19.2 billion
primarily as a result of certain trust customer deposits, which require
collateralization by securities, continuing to shift out of deposits and into
other fee income-producing customer investments.

Domestic money market accounts decreased $1.2 billion to $24.1 billion at
year-end 2018 as the result of a decision to reduce higher-cost retail
brokered sweep deposits that were no longer a necessary component of the
Company's funding strategy. Domestic money market accounts accounted for
approximately 26 percent of total deposits at year-end for both 2018 and 2017.

Included in time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual
retirement accounts. The balance of time deposits increased $505 million in
2018 to $7.4 billion compared to $6.9 billion in 2017 due primarily to higher
rates offered in 2018 on certificates of deposit accounts resulting in account
growth. Time deposits accounted for 8 percent of total deposits in 2018 and 7
percent of total deposits in 2017. See Table 22 "Maturity of Time Deposits of
$100,000 or More" for maturity information.

Short-Term Borrowings

See Note 12 "Short-Term Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
for a summary of these borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The levels of
these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and
the sources utilized.

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions' funding strategy.

The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances
continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity
Risk" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-Term Borrowings

Total long-term borrowings increased approximately $4.3 billion to $12.4
billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $3.2 billion
increase in FHLB advances and $2.4 billion in senior notes issuances. These
increases were partially offset by maturities and a redemption of notes
totaling approximately $1.3 billion during the year.

See Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
for further discussion and detailed listing of outstandings and rates.

On December 20, 2018, Moody's revised the outlook for Regions Financial
Corporation, and its subsidiary, Regions Bank to Positive from Stable,
indicating a possible one-notch upgrade over the next two years. The outlook
upgrade reflected the Company's improved risk asset mix, enhanced risk
management and the improvements in profitability as well as a solid balance
sheet and strong liquidity profile.

On November 8, 2018, DBRS upgraded the ratings of Regions Financial
Corporation, including the Company's senior unsecured debt rating to A (Low)
from BBB (High). At the same time, DBRS upgraded the ratings of Regions Bank,
including the Company's long-term bank deposits to A from A (Low), as well as,
the senior unsecured debt to A from A (Low). DBRS attributed the upgrade to
the progress the Company has made improving credit fundamentals, including
stronger financial results, more rigorous risk management and improved asset
quality.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters

of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial
condition and liquidity. See the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K for more information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

Stockholders' Equity

Stockholders' equity was $15.1 billion at December 31, 2018 as compared to
$16.2 billion at December 31, 2017. During 2018, net income increased
stockholders' equity by $1.8 billion. Cash dividends on common stock and cash
dividends on preferred stock reduced stockholders' equity by $493 million and
$64 million, respectively. Common stock repurchased during 2018 reduced
stockholders' equity by $2.1 billion. These shares were immediately retired
and therefore are not included in treasury stock. Changes in accumulated other
comprehensive income reduced stockholders' equity by $215 million, primarily
due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for
sale as a result of increases in market interest rates during 2018.

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.

See Note 15 "Stockholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CAPITAL RULES

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. See Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the applicable
holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank and, as such, began transitioning to the Basel III Rules in January 2015
subject to a phase-in period extending to January 2019. The Basel III Rules
are now fully phased in, other than with respect to deductions and adjustments
as described below, and among other things, (i) impose a capital measure
called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional
Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1
narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital
measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv)
expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior
regulations. The Basel III Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for
risk-weightings of assets and off-balance sheet exposures to derive the
capital ratios.

Additionally, the Basel III Rules impose a capital conservation buffer
designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital
conservation buffer is on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios and is
equal to the lowest difference between the three risk-based capital ratios
less the applicable minimum required ratio. As of January 1, 2019, the capital
conservation buffer is fully phased in and is 2.5% of CET1 to risk-weighted
assets. In addition, the Basel III Rules provide for a countercyclical capital
buffer applicable only to advanced approach institutions, and therefore not
currently applicable to Regions or Regions Bank. Banking institutions with
ratios that are above the minimum but below the combined capital conservation
buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when applicable, face constraints
on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the
shortfall and the institution's ERI. ERI is compiled using the past four
quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not
reflected in net income.

The Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to
CET1. For example, goodwill and selected other intangible assets, and
disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted. MSRs, certain other deferred tax
assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are
also deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10%
of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the
Basel III Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items
are included; however, standardized approach banking organizations, including
Regions and Regions Bank, were allowed to make a one-time permanent election
to exclude these items. Regions and Regions Bank made this election in order
to avoid significant variations in the level of capital, including the impact
of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities
portfolios.

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on
January 1, 2015 and was to be phased in over a 4-year period, beginning at 40%
on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter. In September
2017, the federal banking agencies proposed to revise and simplify the capital
treatment of selected categories of deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in
non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking
organizations, such as Regions and Regions Bank, that are not subject to the
advanced approach. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies revised the
Basel III Rules

  

72

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

to extend the current transitional treatment of these items for standardized
approach banking organizations until the September 2017 proposal is finalized.
The September 2017 proposal would also change the capital treatment of high
volatility commercial real estate loans under the standardized approach. These
changes would have the impact of increasing regulatory capital ratios for some
standardized approach banking organizations such as Regions. Regions continues
to review the proposal and its impact on the Company's capital requirements.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as
the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the
standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these
standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk
(including by recalibrating risk-weights and introducing new capital
requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as
unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach
for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will
generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor
phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules,
operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to
advanced approach institutions, and not to Regions or Regions Bank. The impact
of Basel IV on the Company will depend on the manner in which it is
implemented by the federal banking regulators.

On April 10, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to simplify
capital rules for large banks. The proposal introduces a SCB, which would
replace the existing capital conservation buffer and incorporate forward-
looking stress test results into non-stress capital requirements. The SCB,
subject to a minimum of 2.5%, would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory
severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests
and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends.
Details of this proposal are discussed under the "Supervision and Regulation--
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Stress Testing" section of the
"Business" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the proposal,
if adopted, would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are
calculated, firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent
constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios.

In December 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that amends
regulatory capital rules to provide banks with the option to phase in the day-
one effects on regulatory capital that may result from adoption of the new
current expected credit losses accounting standard (see the "Recent Accounting
Pronouncements and Accounting Changes" section in Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies"). Additionally, the agencies finalized
amendments to stress testing regulations which delay incorporation of the new
accounting standard in stress testing until the 2020 stress test cycle.

EGRRCPA was enacted on May 24, 2018, and makes limited amendments to the Dodd-
Frank Act as well as modifications to certain other post-crisis regulatory
requirements. With respect to capital requirements, EGRRCPA would make Regions
no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements and change
Regions' supervisory stress testing cycle from annual to biennial. In October
2018, the federal banking agencies proposed rules that would tailor the
application of enhanced prudential standards per the EGRRCPA and would assign
each institution with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as
well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and
five risk-based indicators. According to the Federal Reserve's projections,
Regions would be a "Category IV" institution. Broader discussion of the impact
of EGRRCPA on Regions and Regions Bank is included under the "Supervision and
Regulation" section of the "Business" section of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

On February 5, 2019, the Federal Reserve provided relief to BHCs with assets
between $100 billion and $250 billion, including Regions, in the form of a
one-year extension to the requirement to submit a capital plan to the Federal
Reserve. Thus, Regions must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve by
April 5, 2020, rather than April 5, 2019. In addition, Regions is not subject
to the supervisory capital stress testing or the company-run capital stress
testing requirements for 2019. However, Regions is still required to maintain
a capital plan that is reviewed and approved by Regions' Board of Directors.
Furthermore, while Regions is not required to submit a full capital plan to
the Federal Reserve in 2019, the Company is required to submit its planned
capital actions for the period between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The
Federal Reserve has announced that for the period from July 1, 2019 through
June 30, 2020, Regions, like other firms granted an extension, is approved to
make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed the firm
to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for
any changes in Regions' regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve
acted on Regions' 2018 capital plan.

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules and their applicability to
Regions is included in Note 14 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and
Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO

Regions is currently subject to the Basel III-based U.S. LCR rule, which is a
quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC
maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets under
an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Following the threshold amendments
recently made by EGRRCPA, the LCR rule currently applies in a modified, less
stringent, form to BHCs, such as Regions, having $100 billion or more but less
than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in
total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. However, on October 31, 2018, the
Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC proposed rules that would, among other
things, make institutions such as Regions with less than $250 billion in total
consolidated assets no longer subject to the LCR requirement. The LCR rule
also imposes a monthly calculation requirement. In December 2016, the Federal
Reserve issued a final rule on the public disclosure of the LCR calculation
that requires BHCs, such

  

73

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

as Regions, to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative and
qualitative information about certain components of its LCR beginning with
results from the fourth quarter of 2018.

At December 31, 2018, the Company was fully compliant with the LCR
requirements. Changes in the mix and size of the Company's balance sheet and
investment portfolio are likely to occur in the future, and additional funding
may need to be sourced to remain compliant.

See the "Supervision and Regulation--Liquidity Regulation" subsection of the
"Business" section and the "Risk Factors" section for more information.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt
and equity. See Note 2 "Variable Interest Entities" to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion.

Regions' off-balance sheet credit risk includes obligations for loans sold
with recourse, unfunded loan commitments, and letters of credit. See Note 7
"Servicing of Financial Assets" and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary
in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most
commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in
fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the
implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of
total assets in the banking industry and the resulting level of
capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and
therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.

Management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on
financial results is a direct result of Regions' ability to manage the impact
of changes in interest rates. The Company maintains an asset sensitive
position as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Table 24 "Interest Rate
Sensitivity" for additional details on Regions' interest rate sensitivity.

EFFECTS OF DEFLATION

A period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial
institutions. Potentially, deflation could lead to lower profits, higher
unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic
conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair
bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product
pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans.

Management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on
financial results relates to Regions' ability to maintain a sufficient amount
of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses.
However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it
maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to
develop.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of
operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that
comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that
apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk
management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the
achievement of the Company's strategic objectives.

The primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company's risk
management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational
risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Market risk is the risk to Regions' financial condition resulting from adverse
movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange
rates or equity prices.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Liquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its
obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or
obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the
potential that it cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without
significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or
market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk").  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or
counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Legal risk is the risk that arises from the potential that unenforceable
contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively
affect the operations or condition of the Company.  
  
  

74

* * *

  

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital
arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-
conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or
ethical standards.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding Regions'
business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer
base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and
resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and
operating environment.  
  
Several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the
remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Regions' risk management framework outlines the Company's approach for
managing risk that includes the following four components:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Culture \- A strong, collaborative risk culture ensures focus on risk in all
activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable
effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of
the Company's risk appetite. Our risk culture requires that risks be promptly
identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall
performance of the Company.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Appetite \- The Company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels
of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its objectives.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Process \- Effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools
to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Governance \- Governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management
of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear responsibility and
accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both
existing and emerging risks.  
  
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective
management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company's
approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense
concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

1st Line of Defense activities provide for the identification, acceptance and
ownership of risks.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the
Company's risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company's aggregate
risk levels.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments
of risk management practices across the Company.  
  
The Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The
principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for
evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial
reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated
an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's
establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and
procedures over financial reporting. See the "Financial Disclosures and
Internal Controls" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for
additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of
outside directors to focus on Regions' overall risk profile. The Risk
Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that
reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including
quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk
type. This statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the
tone for the Board's risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the
Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By
establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by
incorporating the needs and goals of its stockholders, regulators, customers
and other stakeholders, the Company's risk appetite is aligned with its
strategic priorities and goals.

The Risk Management Group, led by the Company's Chief Risk Officer, ensures
the consistent application of Regions' risk management approach within the
structure of the Company's operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary
activities of the Risk Management Group include:

|

Interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues
for the Company;

Reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure
the continued appropriateness of risk controls.  
  
As part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes
recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding
adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In
addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of
the Company's internal control structure and related systems and processes.

Management, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal
process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each
business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated,
as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The
Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are
within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement.

Some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and
control risks are described in the remainder of this report. External factors
beyond management's control may result in losses despite the Risk Management
Group's efforts.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income and other financing income in various interest rate scenarios compared
to a base case scenario. Net interest income and other financing income
sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of
Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income and other financing
income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate
cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions
are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of
the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that
results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the
assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the
pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the
characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly
considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts,
prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well
as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income and other financing income
throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate
sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest
rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using "market
forward rates." The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the
traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis
points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company continues
to focus on the minus 100 basis point shock. While not presented, rising and
falling rate scenarios of greater magnitude are also analyzed. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of December 31, 2018, Regions was
asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts
as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending December 2019.
The estimated exposure associated with the parallel yield curve shift of minus
100 basis points in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements
in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest
rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and
1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities
contractually tied to such rates. Recent Fed Funds increases have resulted in
only modest increases in deposit and other funding costs for Regions.
Therefore, it is expected that declines in funding costs will only partially
offset the decline in asset yields. A reduction in intermediate and long-term
interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and
mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly
originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment
portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing
securities in the investment portfolio. At current rate levels, the interest
income sensitivity afforded by potential further extension of investment
securities and the resulting impact on premium amortization is reduced, making
intermediate and long-term interest rate sensitivity primarily attributable to
changes in the level of reinvestment yields on fixed rate assets.

With respect to sensitivity along the yield curve, the balance sheet is
estimated to be asset sensitive to short-term, intermediate-term, and long-
term rates individually. Current simulation models estimate that, as compared
to the base case, net interest income and other financing income over a 12
month horizon would respond favorably by approximately $78 million if
intermediate and

  

76

longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a sustained basis exceed
the base scenario by 100 basis points. Conversely, if intermediate and longer-
term interest rates were to immediately and on a sustained basis underperform
the base case by 100 basis points, then net interest income and other
financing income, as compared to the base case, would decline by approximately
$104 million.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including both long-term and short-term interest rates).
The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities.
Forward starting hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the
extent they start within the measurement horizon. Forward starting hedging
relationships are currently being used to protect net interest income as the
macroeconomic cycle continues to evolve.

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table
24 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the
progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the
scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there
are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income and
other financing income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and
overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the
uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet growth assumptions include moderate loan
and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of
deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by
analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on
management's expectations in the current rate environment. In the + 100 basis
point gradual interest rate change scenario in Table 24, the interest-bearing
deposit re-pricing sensitivity over the 12 month horizon is expected to be
between 60 percent and 70 percent of changes in short-term market rates (e.g.
Fed Funds). Recently observed market rate movements have yielded higher levels
of asset sensitivity than modeled due primarily to outperformance in deposit
betas as compared to the model assumption. A 5 percentage point lower
sensitivity than the baseline assumption would increase 12 month net interest
income and other financing income in the gradual +100 basis points scenario by
approximately $29 million. While the estimates should be used as a guide,
differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market
and competitive factors.

Similarly, management assumes that the change in the mix of deposits in a
rising rate environment versus the baseline balance sheet growth assumptions
is informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in
rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-
bearing products will occur. As the rate cycle has progressed and a mix shift
has become inherent in the baseline forecast, management has reduced the
sensitivity impact on the shock scenarios. The magnitude of the shift is rate
dependent and equates to approximately $1.5 billion over 12 months in the
gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 24. In the event this shift
increased by an additional $1.5 billion over 12 months, the result would be a
reduction of 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the
gradual +100 basis points scenario by approximately $17 million.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
stockholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are

  

77

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps,
options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward
sale commitments.

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a
predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are
executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position and available for sale securities portfolios to a variable-rate
position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan
portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage
interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination
business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale
of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures
contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and
pricing.

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

(1) Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination

A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated above in Table 25
are forward starting, and therefore do not impact, or have limited impact to
the estimated annual change in net interest income and other financing income
discussed in Table 24. As of December 31, 2018, $3.75 billion notional of the
outstanding cash flow swaps were forward starting. All interest rate floors
were forward starting. Forward starting swaps and floors have maturities of
approximately five years after their respective start dates. Subsequent to
December 31, 2018, the Company executed $1.0 billion notional of forward
starting cash flow swaps and $1.0 billion notional of forward starting floors
with similar characteristics, start dates and maturities, to the forward
starting hedges already transacted. Inclusive of these contracts, the total
receive rate and strike price on all forward starting cash flow swaps and
floors was 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All interest rate swap derivatives traded
by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in this
report contains more information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The
overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation
assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note
21 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' year-end
derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative and balance sheet transactions to economically mitigate the impact
of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative
instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the
current risk profile of Regions' current portfolio.

MARKET RISK--PREPAYMENT RISK

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment
speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments.
Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net
interest income and other financing income. For example, mortgage loans and
other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may
refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets
prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in
lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce
Regions' interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising
rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in
opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates.
Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value
of equity. Regions' greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in
its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan
portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to
interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment
risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates,
but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or
indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and
financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either
encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is
extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors.
The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable
expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided.
Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest
income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSR. Regions
actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest
income and other financing income forecasting and interest rate risk
management.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. The liquidity coverage ratio rule is designed
to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary assets on hand to
withstand short-term liquidity disruptions. See the "Liquidity Coverage Ratio"
discussion included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential
litigation contingencies. See Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, borrowed funds and stockholders' equity. Regions' goal in liquidity
management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs.
Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company's funding
requirements is important.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions
performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at
the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy
requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater
of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash
balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company
totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2018. Compliance with the holding company
cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a
quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank
and subsidiaries. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not
currently include any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits
are established within the Company's Liquidity Risk Oversight Committee and
ALCO, which regularly reviews compliance with the established limits.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 4 "Debt
Securities" to the consolidated

  

79

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities
portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing
capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds.
Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one-to-four
family residential first mortgage loans. Regions' liquidity is further
enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can
also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although
Regions does not currently rely on short-term unsecured wholesale market
funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At December 31, 2018,
Regions had approximately $1.5 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, a
decrease from approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The average
balance held with the FRB was approximately $730 million and $2.0 billion
during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents"
section for more information.

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of December 31, 2018, based on
assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $19.0 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2018, Regions'
outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was $8.5 billion and its total
borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled approximately $17.2 billion. FHLB
borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the
FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain securities, commercial and real estate
mortgage loans, residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family
dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the FHLB advances
outstanding. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to
the level of outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The FHLB has
been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of
funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board had authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $5
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Board authorized Regions Bank to
increase the aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time to $10 billion. Refer to Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings" to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section
found earlier in this report for further information regarding the loan
portfolio. See further discussion of the current U.S. economic environment and
counterparty risk below.

Management Process

Credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout
all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken
are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite. The credit quality of
borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings;
however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses
which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and
consumer lending. Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset
quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a
structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. Credit
policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and
adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies
guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and
provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.

Effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification,
measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure,
credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented
a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to
the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.

Occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations
and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. Teams are in place
to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan
modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for
credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in
the portfolio.

For a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the
allowance for credit losses refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates and
Related Policies" section found earlier in this report, and Note 1 "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to
the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for
credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year's
total, are included in Table 15 "Allowance for Credit Losses." Also, refer to
Table 16 "Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses" for details pertaining
to management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses to each loan
category.

Responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks,
including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line
of defense. Credit Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees,
assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first
line of defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a
third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions'
activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk
profile of the Company.

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. Regions forecasts real GDP growth of
approximately 2.6 percent in 2019, with consumer spending, business investment
spending, and government spending the main drivers.

Household balance sheets continue to improve and sustained house price
appreciation has cushioned the effects of recent declines in equity prices on
household net worth. While the rate of growth of household debt has
accelerated, growth nonetheless remains below average growth rates seen over
past cycles and household debt-to-income ratios are significantly lower than
was the case prior to the 2007-09 recession. While recent increases in market
interest rates will have pushed debt service burdens higher, any increases in
debt service burdens follow a sustained period in which household debt service
burdens remained near historical lows. As such, household debt service burdens
remain manageable. Moreover, a higher share of fixed rate debt relative to
past cycles means consumers are more insulated from the effects of rising
interest rates than in past cycles. Ongoing improvement in labor market
conditions in 2019 should lead to faster wage growth, which in turn will
sustain growth in disposable personal income. As a result, consumer spending
will remain a primary driver of economic growth in 2019.

While business investment spending softened over the latter stages of 2018,
that followed what had been notably rapid growth in business spending on
equipment and machinery from the beginning of 2017 through the second quarter
of 2018. Two main factors weighing on business investment spending in
late-2018 were declines in energy prices and, more broadly, growing
uncertainty over trade policy. Nonetheless, Regions believes there is further
upside room for business investment spending in 2019. First, the capital stock
is rather old relative to historical norms, which should facilitate spending
on upgrading/replacing dated facilities and machinery. Second, with labor
becoming more scarce and more expensive, firms have added incentive to invest
in capital to make existing workforces more productive. Incentives for
business investment from Tax Reform remain in place, which should also help
sustain growth in capital spending in 2019.

The housing market is a key question mark for 2019. While it is Regions' view
that supply issues are the primary drag on housing market activity, the
cumulative effect of higher mortgage interest rates and rapid house price
appreciation over the course of 2018 began to erode affordability. By year-end
2018, however, mortgage rates had turned lower and builders were seeing some
relief on input prices, particularly lumber, while inventories of existing
homes for sale had begun to rise, albeit from an exceptionally low base.
Within Regions' footprint, housing market activity continues to grow at a
moderate pace, and a more moderate pace of house price appreciation is
expected in 2019. These factors, along with continued job and income growth,
mean that demand for home purchases should also continue at a moderate pace in
2019.

As expected, inflation did pick up in 2018, but a significant late-year
decline in energy prices led to a deceleration in headline inflation at year-
end. Core inflation, however, continued to gently accelerate through 2018, and
further acceleration is likely in 2019. Services prices will be more
vulnerable to pass-through effects of labor costs rising at a faster rate, and
core goods (i.e., consumer goods excluding food and energy) prices began to
firm up by year-end 2018. Still, any acceleration in core inflation in 2019 is
likely to be gradual and, as such, is unlikely to prompt the FOMC to move at a
faster pace in raising the Fed funds rate.

The "dot plot" released in conjunction with the December 2018 FOMC meeting
implied a total of two 25 basis point increases in the Fed funds rate target
range in 2019, though many participants expect no more increases. At the same
time, market participants became less positive in their outlooks for economic
growth, which led to a flatter yield curve over the latter phases of 2018. The
FOMC is looking to move away from forward guidance, towards a more "data
dependent" approach to setting monetary policy.

For the Regions footprint as a whole, rates of job, income, and overall
economic growth have been and are expected to remain broadly consistent with
those seen nationally. There are, however, differences in rates of growth
among the individual states and metropolitan areas across the footprint. Those
markets which are larger and more economically diverse and boast more
favorable demographic trends have been and are expected to remain among the
better performing markets within Regions' footprint. The pace of job growth
within Regions' footprint accelerated in 2018, and job growth remained notably
broad based across the major industry groups. Manufacturing has been a support
for overall economic activity across the Regions footprint, but this is one
sector, along with agriculture, that is most vulnerable to intensifying trade
disputes between the U.S. and China. Still, steady job growth over the course
of 2019 is expected to keep downward pressure on unemployment rates across the
footprint.

In summation, real GDP growth is expected to be approximately 2.6 percent in
2019, with consumer spending, business investment, and government spending the
main drivers of growth. Global economic growth is expected to moderate in
2019, but exports should still be additive to U.S. economic growth in 2019.
Gradual acceleration in core inflation is expected. However, if inflation
accelerates more rapidly than anticipated, and in turn prompts the FOMC to
become more aggressive in raising the Fed funds rate, there would be downside
risk to the Company's baseline outlook, as this would have an adverse impact
on asset prices and likely have an adverse impact on the broader economy.
Other downside risks include elevated uncertainty over trade policy and
geopolitical tensions, including growing political unrest across much of
Europe. Upside potential includes elevated consumer confidence and solid
growth in disposable income lead to a faster than anticipated pace of growth
in consumer spending, and the possibility that productivity growth responds
faster and more favorably to an increase in business investment than
anticipated.

Counterparty Risk

Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or
contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal
obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as commercial
banks, insurance companies, broker dealers, etc.) or a corporate client.

Regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of
counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible
for the independent credit risk management of financial institution
counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for
the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate
and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk
management of client side counterparties.

Financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types
generated in one or more departments of the Company. Exposure limits are
established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the Company.
Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk management
product to hedge risks in the client's business. Exposures to counterparties
are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security
risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks
that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, including
technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the
increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to
conduct more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states,
activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify
and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its
information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and
vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems
and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls
are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and
transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing
practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure
its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the
resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue
to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to protect its
systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a
strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due
diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.

Regions' system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide
protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security
matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient
resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively
engaged in the oversight of Regions' continuous efforts to reinforce and
enhance its operational resilience. The Board monitors Regions' information
management risk policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee,
which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology
activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and
cybersecurity; approval and oversight of information security risk
assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery,
business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board's
Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions' cybersecurity practices, mainly by
receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the
Chief Information Security Officer, risk management, and Internal Audit. The
Board, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on
information security matters.

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to
gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions
to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is
a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services
sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third
party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability
and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so
information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to
other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC,
Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its
members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and
fraud topics.

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation.
These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions
in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant
resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these
measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure,
Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading
consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also
developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans
that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the
effects of any such event. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to data
breaches may be offset by applicable insurance.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations
and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of
its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and
monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions'
reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event.

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

Regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally
include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Regions' process for evaluating
internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks
facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or
mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are
in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools
are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the
internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places
responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure
that controls are effective.

Regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and
procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC
are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information
required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information
is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Regions' Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the
legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and
treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external
events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in
reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with
the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from
accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC
Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose
to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in Regions' internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company's
Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete and timely. As part of this
process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from
Regions' associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring
effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are
reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company's
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is
presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and
the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and
other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a
quarterly basis.

As required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO
and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions'
periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of
disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial
reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the
previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and
makes refinements as necessary.

COMPARISON OF 2017 WITH 2016--CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion,
or $1.00 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion, or $0.87
per diluted share in 2016. Regions also reported net income from continuing
operations available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion, or $1.00 per
diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion, or $0.87 per diluted
share, in 2016.

Net interest income and other financing income from continuing operations was
$3.5 billion and $3.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflecting a
decrease in average earning assets to $109.2 billion from $111.0 billion at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net interest margin from
continuing operations (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.32 percent in 2017,
compared to 3.14 percent during 2016, reflecting increases in yields on
earning assets, particularly loans, exceeding the slight increase in total
funding costs.

Non-interest income from continuing operations decreased $49 million to $2.0
billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was due to insurance proceeds
received in 2016, as well as decreases in BOLI, other miscellaneous income,
and mortgage income. These decreases more than offset increases in service
charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, and investment management and
trust fee income. See Table 5 "Non-Interest Income from Continuing Operations"
for additional information.

Insurance proceeds recognized in 2016 were related to the settlement of the
previously disclosed and accrued 2010 class-action lawsuit.

Bank-owned life insurance decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to
a gain on exchange of policies that was recognized in the first quarter of
2016 and reduced claim benefits in 2017.

Other miscellaneous income decreased $47 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The
decrease was primarily due to operating lease impairment charges of $22
million recorded in 2017, declines in net revenue from affordable housing, and
a recovery of approximately $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil
spill recorded in 2016.

Mortgage income decreased $24 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease
was due to lower production, spread compression, and a reduction in the
valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedges. The decreases were
partially offset by increase in mortgage servicing income as a result of
purchasing the rights to service a total of approximately $2.7 billion in
residential mortgage loans during 2017. See Note 7 "Servicing of Financial
Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

Service charges on deposit accounts increased $19 million in 2017 compared to
2016. The increase was primarily due to overall account growth resulting in
increases in non-sufficient fund fees.

Card and ATM fees increased $15 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase
was primarily the result of checking account and active credit card growth
resulting in higher interchange income.

Investment management and trust fee income increased $17 million in 2017
compared to 2016. The increase was driven primarily from the increase in
assets under administration and growth in the equity markets.

Non-interest expense from continuing operations increased $8 million in 2017
compared to 2016. Increases in salaries and employee benefits, furniture and
equipment expense, outside services, FDIC insurance assessments, and
professional, legal, and regulatory expenses occurred in 2017. These increases
were offset by decreases in branch consolidation, property and equipment

charges, provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses and loss on early
extinguishment of debt. See Table 6 "Non-Interest Expense from Continuing
Operations" for additional information.

Total salaries and employee benefits increased $32 million in 2017 as compared
to 2016. The increase was primarily due to merit increases, increased expenses
from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes and $12 million in pension
settlement charges in 2017. The expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes are offset in non-interest income. Full-time equivalent
headcount decreased to 21,014 at December 31, 2017 from 21,402 at December 31,
2016, reflecting the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of
its three-year strategic plan and serving to partially offset the
aforementioned increases.

Furniture and equipment expense increased $14 million in 2017 as compared to
2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased depreciation related to
the completion of certain capital investment projects.

Outside services increased $18 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The
increase was primarily due to increased servicing costs related to point-of-
sale lending through third parties and additional expenses recorded related to
a new Wealth Management platform.

FDIC insurance assessments increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily
due to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge that went into
effect during the third quarter of 2016, and was in place throughout 2017, as
well as the impact of a $6 million refund recognized in the second quarter of
2016.

Professional, legal, and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to
legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges.
Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased during 2017 compared to
2016 due primarily to a legal recovery of $7 million that was recognized in
2016.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation
adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made.
Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased
branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy
optimization initiatives.

Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses decreased $33 million in 2017
compared to 2016. The (credit) for unfunded credit losses in 2017 was
primarily due to a reduction in the level of risk estimated for the unfunded
credit commitments in the commercial and industrial portfolio. The provision
for unfunded credit losses during 2016 was attributable to increases in the
commercial and industrial reserve rates for unfunded commitments and letters
of credit and a large specific reserve on an unfunded energy credit.

In 2016, the Company purchased approximately $649 million of its 2.00% senior
notes due May 2018. The pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment related to
this tender offer was approximately $14 million.

The Company's income tax expense from continuing operations for 2017 was $619
million compared to $510 million in 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate
of 33.3 percent and 30.6 percent, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses totaled $934 million or
1.17 percent of total loans, net of unearned income compared to $1.1 billion
or 1.36 percent at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $307 million, or
0.38 percent of average loans in 2017 compared to $277 million, or 0.34
percent of average loans in 2016, reflecting some large-dollar commercial loan
charge-offs within the energy, healthcare and education sectors. During 2017,
the provision for loan losses was $150 million as compared to $262 million in
2016. The decrease in the provision for loan losses in 2017 compared to 2016
was the result of improving economic conditions driving broad-based
improvements in credit metrics, particularly in the latter half of 2017. Non-
performing assets decreased from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016, to $740
million at December 31, 2017.

Item 8\. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of the Management of Regions Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries (the "Company"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. Regions' internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and
actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

All internal controls systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements in the Company's
financial statements, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding
of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Regions' management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in its 2013 Internal Control
--Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe and assert that,
as of December 31, 2018, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Regions' independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit
report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. This report appears on the following page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial
Corporation

  

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). In our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes of the Company and our
report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial
Corporation

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regions
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and
our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

  

![eyllpsignature201510ka47.jpg](eyllpsignature201510ka47.jpg)

We have served as the Company's auditor since 1971.

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions" or the "Company") provides a full
range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the
South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial
institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other
adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain of those regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the periods
presented. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used
in the consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to, the
estimates and assumptions related to the allowance for credit losses, fair
value measurements, intangibles, residential MSRs and income taxes.

Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and
disclosure through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance related to several
accounting topics. The cumulative effect of the retrospective application was
a total reduction to retained earnings of $2 million, of which the individual
components were immaterial. All prior period amounts impacted by guidance that
required retrospective application have been revised.

Certain amounts in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation, except as otherwise noted. These
reclassifications are immaterial and have no effect on net income,
comprehensive income (loss), total assets or total stockholders' equity as
previously reported.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regions, its
subsidiaries and certain VIEs. Significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Regions considers a voting rights entity to
be a subsidiary and consolidates it if Regions has a controlling financial
interest in the entity. VIEs are consolidated if Regions has the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that significantly impact financial
performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., Regions is
the primary beneficiary). The determination of whether Regions is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Investments in
companies which are not VIEs but in which Regions has significant influence
over the operating and financing decisions, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Investments in VIEs, where Regions is not the primary
beneficiary of a VIE, are accounted for using either the proportional
amortization method or the equity method of accounting. These investments are
included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The maximum
potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally
limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and
any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in
substantially the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured.
Refer to Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding Regions' significant
VIEs.

Unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be
accounted for under the equity method and do not have a readily determinable
fair value are accounted for at cost under the measurement alternative with
adjustments for impairment and observable price changes as applicable. Cost
method investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets. Dividends received or receivable and observable price changes from
these investments are included as a component of other non-interest income in
the consolidated statements of income.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. On January 11, 2012,
Regions entered into an agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related
affiliates. The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. Results of operations for
the entities sold are presented separately as discontinued operations for all
periods presented on the consolidated statements of income. Other expenses
related to the transaction are also included in discontinued operations. See
Note 3 and Note 24 for further discussion.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS

Cash equivalents represent assets that can be converted into cash immediately.
At Regions, these assets include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits in other banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired,
are classified at that time according to management's intent to either sell or
hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management's intent is to sell
the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented

as operating cash flows. When management's intent is to hold the loan for the
foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing
cash flows.

years ended December 31:

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER
AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions.
It is Regions' policy to take possession of securities purchased under resell
agreements either through direct delivery or a tri-party agreement.

DEBT SECURITIES

Management determines the appropriate accounting classification of debt
securities at the time of purchase, based on intent, and periodically re-
evaluates such designations. Debt securities are classified as held to
maturity when the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity. Debt securities held to maturity are presented at amortized cost.
Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available
for sale. Debt securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair
value with changes in unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See the "Fair
Value Measurements" section below for discussion of determining fair value.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held to maturity and
available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the
estimated life of the security, using the interest method. Such amortization
or accretion is included in interest income on securities. Realized gains and
losses are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.

The Company reviews its securities portfolio on a regular basis to determine
if there are any conditions indicating that a security has other-than-
temporary impairment. For debt securities, factors include the credit standing
of the issuer, whether the Company expects to receive all scheduled principal
and interest payments, Regions' intent to sell and whether it is more likely
than not that the Company will have to sell the security before its market
value recovers. For debt securities, activity related to the credit loss
component of other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings as part
of net securities gains (losses). Refer to Note 4 for further detail and
information on securities.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Regions' loans held for sale include commercial loans, investor real estate
loans and residential real estate mortgage loans. Loans held for sale are
recorded at either estimated fair value, if the fair value option is elected,
or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Regions has elected to account
for residential real estate mortgages originated with the intent to sell at
fair value. Intent is established for these conforming residential real estate
mortgage loans when Regions enters into an interest rate lock commitment.
Gains and losses on these residential mortgage loans held for sale for which
the fair value option has been elected are included in mortgage income.
Certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale where management has elected
the fair value option are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses on
commercial mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value option has
been elected are included in capital markets income. Regions also transfers
certain commercial, investor real estate, and residential real estate mortgage
portfolio loans to held for sale when management has the intent to sell in the
near term. These held for sale loans are recorded at the lower of cost or
estimated fair value. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are
recorded as charge-offs and a new cost basis is established. Any subsequent
lower of cost or market adjustment is determined on an individual loan basis
and is recognized in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses on the sale
of non-performing commercial and investor real estate loans are included in
other non-interest expense when realized as such amounts are viewed as credit
costs. Gains and losses on

  

96

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

sales of performing loans are included in non-interest income. See the "Fair
Value Measurements" section below for discussion of determining estimated fair
value.

LOANS

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable
future or until maturity or payoff are considered loans held for investment
(or portfolio loans). Loans held for investment are carried at the principal
amount outstanding, net of premiums, discounts, unearned income and deferred
loan fees and costs. Regions' loans balance is comprised of commercial,
investor real estate and consumer loans. Interest income on all types of loans
is accrued based on the contractual interest rate and the principal amount
outstanding using methods that approximate the interest method, except for
those loans classified as non-accrual. Premiums and discounts on purchased
loans and non-refundable loan origination and commitment fees, net of direct
costs of originating or acquiring loans, are deferred and recognized over the
estimated lives of the related loans as an adjustment to the loans' constant
effective yield, which is included in interest income on loans. See Note 5 for
further detail and information on loans.

Regions engages in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net
investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum lease payments
and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Unearned income is
recognized over the terms of the leases to produce a constant effective yield.
The net investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease payments (less
non-recourse debt payments) and estimated residual values, less unearned
income. Income from leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases
based on the unrecovered equity investment.

Regions determines past due or delinquency status of a loan based on
contractual payment terms.

Commercial and investor real estate loans are placed on non-accrual if any of
the following conditions occur: 1) collection in full of contractual principal
and interest is no longer reasonably assured (even if current as to payment
status), 2) a partial charge-off has occurred, unless the loan has been
brought current under its contractual terms (original or restructured terms)
and the full originally contracted principal and interest is considered to be
fully collectible, or 3) the loan is delinquent on any principal or interest
for 90 days or more unless the obligation is secured by collateral having a
net realizable value (estimated fair value less costs to sell) sufficient to
fully discharge the obligation and the loan is in the legal process of
collection. Factors considered regarding full collection include assessment of
changes in borrower's cash flow, valuation of underlying collateral, ability
and willingness of guarantors to provide credit support, and other conditions.
Charge-offs on commercial and investor real estate loans are primarily based
on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan and occur when available
information confirms the loan is not or will not be fully collectible. Factors
considered in making these determinations are the borrower's and any
guarantor's ability and willingness to pay, the status of the account in
bankruptcy court (if applicable), and collateral value. Commercial and
investor real estate loan relationships of $250,000 or less are subject to
charge-off or charge down to estimated fair value at 180 days past due, based
on collateral value.

Non-accrual and charge-off decisions for consumer loans are dictated by the
FFIEC's Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy
which establishes standards for the classification and treatment of consumer
loans. The charge-off process drives consumer non-accrual status as follows.
If a consumer loan secured by real estate in a first lien position
(residential first mortgage or home equity) becomes 180 days past due, Regions
evaluates the loan for non-accrual status and potential charge-off based on
net loan to value exposure. For home equity loans and lines of credit in a
second lien position, the evaluation is performed at 120 days past due. If a
loan is secured by collateral having a net realizable value sufficient to
fully discharge the obligation, then a partial write-down is not necessary and
the loan remains on accrual status, provided it is in the process of legal
collection. If a partial charge-off is necessary as a result of the
evaluation, then the remaining balance is placed on non-accrual. Consumer
loans not secured by real estate are generally charged-off at either 120 days
past due for closed-end loans, 180 days past due for open-end loans other than
credit cards or the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past
due for credit cards.

When loans are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest,
amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and
amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees/costs are discontinued. When
a commercial or investor real estate loan is placed on non-accrual status,
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed and charged to
interest income. Uncollected interest accrued from prior years on commercial
and investor real estate loans placed on non-accrual status in the current
year is charged against the allowance for loan losses. When a consumer loan is
placed on non-accrual status, all uncollected interest accrued is reversed and
charged to interest income due to immateriality. Interest collections on
commercial and investor real estate non-accrual loans are applied as principal
reductions. Interest collections on consumer loans are recorded using the cash
basis, due to immateriality.

All loans on non-accrual status may be returned to accrual status and interest
accrual resumed if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the loan is
brought contractually current as to both principal and interest, 2) future
payments are reasonably expected to continue being received in accordance with
the terms of the loan and repayment ability can be reasonably demonstrated,
and 3) the loan has been performing for at least six months.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Regions' allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components:
the allowance for loan losses, which is recorded as a contra-asset to loans,
and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments, which is recorded in other
liabilities. The allowance is reduced by actual losses (charge-offs) and
increased by recoveries, if any. Regions charges losses against the allowance
in the period the loss is confirmed. All adjustments to the allowance for loan
losses are charged directly to expense through the provision for loan losses.
All adjustments to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments are recorded in
other non-interest expense.

The allowance is maintained at a level believed appropriate by management to
absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan and unfunded credit
commitment portfolios in accordance with GAAP and regulatory guidelines.
Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is a
quarterly process and is based on an evaluation and rating of the loan
portfolio segments, historical loan loss experience, current economic
conditions, collateral values securing loans, levels of problem loans, volume,
growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio, regulatory guidance,
and other relevant factors. Changes in any of these, or other factors, or the
availability of new information, could require that the allowance be adjusted
in future periods. Actual losses could vary from management's estimates.
Management attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates and
determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates
collectively. However, the entire allowance is available to cover all charge-
offs that arise from the loan portfolio.

CALCULATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Commercial and Investor Real Estate Components

Impaired Loans

Loans deemed to be impaired include non-accrual loans, excluding consumer
loans, and all TDRs. Regions considers the current value of collateral, credit
quality of any guarantees, guarantor's liquidity and willingness to repay, the
loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan
is impaired. Other factors may include the industry and geographic region of
the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and
leverage of the borrower and Regions' evaluation of the borrower's management.
For non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans (including TDRs)
equal to or greater than $2.5 million, the allowance for loan losses is based
on a note-level evaluation considering the facts and circumstances specific to
each borrower. For these loans, Regions measures the level of impairment based
on the present value of the estimated cash flows, the estimated value of the
collateral or, if available, the observable market price. Regions generally
uses the estimated cash flow method to measure impairment. For commercial and
investor real estate accruing TDRs and all non-accruing loans less than $2.5
million, the allowance for loan losses is based on a discounted cash flow
analysis performed at the note level, where estimated projected cash flows
reflect credit losses based on statistical information (including historical
default information) derived from loans with similar risk characteristics
(e.g., credit quality indicator and product type) using PDs and LGDs as
described in the following paragraph.

Non-Impaired Loans

For all other commercial and investor real estate loans, the allowance for
loan losses is calculated at a pool level based on credit quality indicators
and product type. Statistically determined PDs and LGDs are calculated based
on historical default and loss information for similar loans. The historical
default and loss information is measured over a relevant period for each loan
pool. The pool level allowance is calculated using the PD and LGD estimates
and is adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of long-term
average loss experience compared to previously forecasted losses, external
loss data and other risks identified from current economic conditions and
credit quality trends. Various one year PD measurements are used in
conjunction with life-of-loan LGD measurements to estimate incurred losses. As
a result, losses are effectively covered over a two to three year period for
loans that are currently in default and those estimated to default within the
next twelve months.

Consumer Components

For consumer loans, the classes are segmented into pools of loans with similar
risk characteristics. For most consumer loan pools, historical losses are the
primary factor in establishing the allowance allocated to each pool. The
twelve month loss rate is the basis for the allocation and it may be adjusted
based on deteriorating trends, portfolio growth, or other factors determined
by management to be relevant.

The allowance for loan losses for the residential first mortgage non-TDR pool
is calculated based on a twelve-month historical loss rate segmented based on
the following risk characteristics: past due and accrual status and further by
geography, property use and amortization type for accruing, non-past due
loans. The allowance for loan losses for residential first mortgage TDRs is
calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis on pools of homogeneous
loans. Cash flows are projected using the restructured terms and then
discounted at the original note rate. The projected cash flows assume a
default rate, which is based on historical performance of residential first
mortgage TDRs. The allowance for loan losses for the home equity pool is
calculated based on a twelve-month historical loss rate segmented based on the
following risk characteristics: lien position, TDR status, geography, non-
accrual and past due status, and refreshed FICO scores for accruing, non-past
due loans.

Qualitative Factors

While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors,
any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of
imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent
time lag of obtaining information and variations between estimates and actual
outcomes. Regions adjusts the allowance in consideration of quantitative and
qualitative factors which may not be directly measured in the note-level or
pooled calculations, including, but not limited to:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Credit quality trends,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Loss experience in particular portfolios,

Volatility associated with large individual credits.  
  
Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

In order to estimate a reserve for unfunded commitments, Regions uses a
process consistent with that used in developing the allowance for loan losses.
The reserve is based on an EAD multiplied by a PD multiplied by an LGD. The
EAD is estimated based on an analysis of historical funding patterns for
defaulted loans in various categories. The PD and LGD align with the
statistically-calculated parameters used to calculate the allowance for loan
losses for various pools, which are based on credit quality indicators and
product type. The methodology applies to commercial and investor real estate
credit commitments and standby letters of credit that are not unconditionally
cancellable.

Refer to Note 6 for further discussion regarding the calculation of the
allowance for credit losses.

TDRs

TDRs are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at
the time of restructuring, and Regions has granted a concession to the
borrower. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery
on the loan and may take the form of modifications made with the stated
interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar
risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of
normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in limited circumstances
forgiveness of principal and/or interest. TDRs can involve loans remaining on
non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending
on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. TDRs are subject to
policies governing accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other
loans of the same product type as discussed in the "Loans" section above. All
loans with the TDR designation are considered to be impaired, even if they are
accruing. See the "Calculation of Allowance For Credit Losses" section above
for Regions' allowance for loan losses methodology related to TDRs.

The CAP was designed to evaluate potential consumer loan participants as early
as possible in the life cycle of the troubled loan (as described in Note 6).
Many of the modifications are finalized without the borrower ever reaching the
applicable number of days past due, and therefore the loan may never be placed
on non-accrual. Accordingly, given the positive impact of the restructuring on
the likelihood of recovery of cash flows due under the modified terms, accrual
status continues to be appropriate for these loans.

OTHER EARNING ASSETS

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB
stock, marketable equity securities and operating lease assets. See Note 8 for
additional information.

INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK

Ownership of FRB and FHLB stock is a requirement for all banks seeking
membership into and access to the services provided by these banking systems.
These shares are accounted for at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in net income.

INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING LEASES

Investments in operating leases represent the assets underlying the related
lease contracts and are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
net of origination fees and costs. Depreciation on these assets is generally
provided on a straight-line basis over the lease term down to an estimated
residual value. Regions periodically evaluates its depreciation rate for
leased assets based on projected residual values and adjusts depreciation
expense over the remaining life of the lease if deemed appropriate. Regions
also evaluates the current value of the operating lease assets and tests for
impairment when indicators of impairment are present. Income from operating
lease assets includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs,
and is recognized as

  

99

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the scheduled lease
term. The accrual of revenue on operating leases is generally discontinued at
the time an account is determined to be uncollectible. Operating lease revenue
and the depreciation expense on the related operating lease assets are
included as components of net interest income and other financing income on
the consolidated statements of income. When a leased asset is returned, its
remaining value is reclassified from other earning assets to other assets and
recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell, on
Regions' consolidated balance sheet. Impairment of the operating lease asset,
as well as residual value gains and losses at the end of the lease term are
recorded through other non-interest income.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization, as applicable. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation expense is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the
leases, if shorter). Generally, premises and leasehold improvements are
depreciated or amortized over 7-40 years. Furniture and equipment are
generally depreciated or amortized over 3-10 years. Premises and equipment are
evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense in
the consolidated statements of income. Improvements that extend the useful
life of the asset are capitalized to the carrying value and depreciated. See
Note 9 for detail of premises and equipment.

Regions enters into lease transactions for the right to use assets. These
leases vary in term and, from time to time, include incentives and/or rent
escalations. Examples of incentives include periods of "free" rent and
leasehold improvement incentives. Regions recognizes incentives and
escalations on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of or
increase to rent expense, as applicable, within net occupancy expense in the
consolidated statements of income.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets include goodwill, which is the excess of cost over the fair
value of net assets of acquired businesses, and other identifiable intangible
assets. Other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the following:
1) core deposit intangible assets, which are amounts recorded related to the
value of acquired indeterminate maturity deposits, 2) amounts capitalized
related to the value of acquired customer relationships, and 3) the DUS
license. Core deposit intangibles and certain other identifiable intangibles
are amortized on an accelerated basis over their expected useful lives.

The Company's goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the
fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there
may be impairment. Regions assesses the following indicators of goodwill
impairment for each reporting period:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Recent operating performance,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in market capitalization,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Regulatory actions and assessments,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors and
competition),  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset
impairments, and business dispositions), and  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Trends in the banking industry.  
  
Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other
factors could result in a decline in the implied estimated fair value of
goodwill. Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative
factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the
evidence, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair
value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the
Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is
more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a
two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. Step One compares the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including
goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the
second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount
of impairment loss, if any. Step Two of the goodwill impairment test compares
the implied estimated fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill for that reporting
unit exceeds the implied estimated fair value of that unit's goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in other non-interest expense in an amount equal
to that excess.

For purposes of performing the qualitative assessment, Regions evaluates
events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, events and
circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance
including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization,
regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-
specific factors, and trends in the banking industry to determine if it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
carrying amount.

For purposes of performing Step One of the goodwill impairment test, if
applicable, Regions uses both income and market approaches to value its
reporting units. The income approach, which is the primary valuation approach,
consists of discounting projected long-term future cash flows, which are
derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective
reporting units. The significant inputs to the income approach include
expected future cash flows, the long-term target equity ratios, and the
discount rate.

For purposes of performing Step Two of the goodwill impairment test, if
applicable, Regions compares the implied estimated fair value of the reporting
unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In order to determine
the implied estimated fair value, a full purchase price allocation would be
performed in the same manner as if a business combination had occurred. As
part of the Step Two analysis, Regions estimates the fair value of all of the
assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized assets
and liabilities. The related valuation methodologies for certain material
financial assets and liabilities are discussed in the "Fair Value
Measurements" section below.

Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles,
purchased credit card relationships and other acquired customer relationships,
are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or
circumstances that could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset.
These events could include loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit
card or other types of acquired customer accounts and/or balances, increased
competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent other
identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, impairment losses are
recorded in other non-interest expense and reduce the carrying amount of the
asset.

Refer to Note 10 for further detail and discussion of the results of the
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles impairment tests.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

Regions accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when control over
the transferred assets is surrendered. Control is generally considered to have
been surrendered when 1) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the
Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other
receivership, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets
with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a
trivial benefit to the Company, and 3) the Company does not maintain the
obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. If these
sale criteria are met, the transferred assets are removed from the Company's
balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If not met, the
transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing, and the assets remain on the
Company's balance sheet, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a
liability, and gain or loss on sale is deferred until the sale criterion are
achieved.

Regions has elected to account for its residential MSRs using the fair value
measurement method. Under the fair value measurement method, residential MSRs
are measured at estimated fair value each period with changes in fair value
recorded as a component of mortgage income. The fair value of residential MSRs
is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market
discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors.
A significant change in prepayments of residential mortgages in the servicing
portfolio could result in significant valuation adjustments, thus creating
potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The valuation
method relies on an OAS to consider prepayment risk and equate the asset's
discounted cash flows to its market price. See the "Fair Value Measurements"
section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value.

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions' related commercial MSRs are recorded in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or estimated
fair value and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period
that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of
the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and
timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results
and updated projections. Regions periodically evaluates its commercial MSRs
for impairment. Regions has a one-third loss share guarantee associated with
the majority of the DUS servicing portfolio. The other two-thirds loss share
guarantee is retained by Fannie Mae. The estimated fair value of the loss
share guarantee is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets.

Refer to Note 7 for further information on servicing of financial assets.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY AND OTHER REAL ESTATE

Other real estate and certain other assets acquired in satisfaction of
indebtedness ("foreclosure") are carried in other assets at the lower of the
recorded investment in the loan or estimated fair value less estimated costs
to sell the property. At the date of transfer from the loan portfolio, if the
recorded investment in the loan exceeds the property's estimated fair value
less estimated costs to sell, a write-down is recorded against the allowance.
Regions allows a period of up to 60 days after the date of transfer to record
finalized write-downs as charge-offs against the allowance in order to
properly accumulate all related invoices and updated valuation information, if
necessary. Subsequent to transfer, Regions obtains valuations from
professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers on at least an
annual basis. See the "Fair Value Measurements" section below for additional
discussion regarding determination of fair value. Subsequent to transfer and
the additional 60 days, any further write-downs are recorded as

  

101

other non-interest expense. Gain or loss on the sale of foreclosed property
and other real estate is included in other non-interest expense. At December
31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying values of foreclosed properties were
immaterial.

From time to time, assets classified as premises and equipment are transferred
to held for sale for various reasons. These assets are carried in other assets
at the lower of the recorded investment in the asset or estimated fair value
less estimated cost to sell based upon the property's appraised value at the
date of transfer. Any write-downs of property held for sale are recorded as
other non-interest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest
rate risk, facilitate asset/liability management strategies and manage other
exposures. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps, options on
interest rate swaps, options including interest rate caps and floors,
Eurodollar futures, forward rate contracts and forward sale commitments. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance
sheets as other assets or other liabilities, as applicable, at estimated fair
value. Regions enters into master netting agreements with counterparties
and/or requires collateral to cover exposures. In at least some cases,
counterparties post collateral at a zero threshold regardless of credit
rating. The majority of interest rate derivatives traded by Regions with
dealing counterparties are subject to mandatory clearing through a central
clearinghouse. The variation margin payments made for derivatives cleared
through a central clearinghouse are legally characterized as settlements of
the derivatives. As a result, these positions are reflected as settled with no
fair value presented for purposes of the balance sheet and related
disclosures. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from
the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the
risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse.

Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments based upon
notional amounts. Interest rate swaps subject Regions to market risk
associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility
as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Option
contracts involve rights to buy or sell financial instruments on a specified
date or over a period at a specified price. These rights do not have to be
exercised. Some option contracts such as interest rate floors, involve the
exchange of cash based on changes in specified indices. Interest rate floors
are contracts to hedge interest rate declines based on a notional amount,
generally associated with a principal balance at risk. Interest rate floors
subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates,
changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the
counterparty will fail to perform. Forward rate contracts are commitments to
buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or
yield. Regions primarily enters into forward rate contracts on marketable
instruments, which expose Regions to market risk associated with changes in
the value of the underlying financial instrument, as well as the credit risk
that the counterparty will fail to perform. Eurodollar futures are futures
contracts on Eurodollar deposits. Eurodollar futures subject Regions to market
risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are
cash settled daily through a margining process in an exchange, there is
minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Forward sale
commitments are sales of securities at a specified price at a future date.
Forward sale commitments subject Regions to market risk associated with
changes in market value, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will
fail to perform.

The Company elects to account for certain derivative financial instruments as
accounting hedges which, based on the exposure being hedged, are either fair
value or cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of the hedged risk in an asset, liability or firm commitment. Under the fair
value hedging model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value
of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses attributable to
the change in fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in interest income
or interest expense in the same income statement line item with the hedged
item in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. To the extent the
changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair
value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding
adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the
hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the
derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to other assets or other
liabilities, as applicable.

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions. For cash flow hedge
relationships, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income except for amounts
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings in
the same income statement line item where the earnings effect of the hedged
item is presented in the period or periods during which the hedged item
impacts earnings.

The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge
transactions. The Company performs periodic qualitative and quantitative
assessments to determine whether the hedging relationship has been highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items
and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in
the future.

If a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is
discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm
commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not
occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded as an other asset or other
liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in other non-interest expense. Any asset or
liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm

  

102

commitment is removed from the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in
other non-interest expense. Gains and losses that were unrecognized and
aggregated in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) pursuant to the
hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in other non-
interest expense.

Derivative contracts for which the Company has not elected to apply hedge
accounting are classified as other assets or liabilities with gains and losses
related to the change in fair value recognized in capital markets fee income
and other or mortgage income, as applicable, in the statements of income
during the period. These positions, as well as non-derivative instruments, are
used to mitigate economic and accounting volatility related to customer
derivative transactions, the mortgage pipeline and the fair value of
residential MSRs.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate.
Accordingly, such commitments are recorded at estimated fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets fee
income and other, as applicable. Regions also has corresponding forward sale
commitments related to these interest rate lock commitments, which are
recorded at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in
mortgage income or capital markets fee income and other, as applicable. See
the "Fair Value Measurements" section below for additional information related
to the valuation of interest rate lock commitments.

Regions enters into various derivative agreements with customers desiring
protection from possible future market fluctuations. Regions manages the
market risk associated with these derivative agreements. The contracts in this
portfolio for which the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting are
marked-to-market through earnings and included in other assets and other
liabilities.

Concurrent with the election to use fair value measurement for residential
MSRs, Regions began using various derivative instruments to mitigate the
impact of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs in the statements of
income. This effort may involve the use of various derivative instruments,
including, but not limited to, forwards, futures, swaps and options. These
derivatives are carried at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value
reported in mortgage income.

Refer to Note 21 for further discussion and details of derivative financial
instruments and hedging activities.

INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
expected future tax consequences. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the
differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding
tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for
any tax attributes, such as tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards.
The net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in other
assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as
appropriate. Any effect of a change in federal and state tax rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period
that includes the enactment date. Excluding the effects of Tax Reform, as
discussed in Note 20 and the "Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting
Changes" section below, the impact of changes in tax rates related to
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
is immaterial. The Company reflects the expected amount of income tax to be
paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit, as
applicable.

The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering
all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent
operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future
taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards
and tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is recorded for any
deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized.

Income tax benefits generated from uncertain tax positions are accounted for
using the recognition and cumulative-probability measurement thresholds. Based
on the technical merits, if a tax benefit is not more-likely-than-not of being
sustained upon examination, the Company records a liability for the recognized
income tax benefit. If a tax benefit is more-likely-than-not of being
sustained based on the technical merits, the Company utilizes the cumulative
probability measurement and records an income tax benefit equivalent to the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company
recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits within current income tax expense.

The Company applies the proportional amortization method in accounting for its
qualified affordable housing investments. This method recognizes the amortized
cost of the investment as a component of income tax expense.

The deferral method of accounting is used for investments that generate
investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are
recognized as a reduction of the related asset.

Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding income taxes.

TREASURY STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES

The purchase of the Company's common stock is recorded at cost. At the date of
repurchase, stockholders' equity is reduced by the repurchase price. Upon
retirement, or upon purchase for constructive retirement, treasury stock would
be reduced by the cost of such stock with the excess of repurchase price over
par or stated value recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the Company
subsequently reissues treasury shares, treasury stock is reduced by the cost
of such stock with differences recorded in additional paid-in capital or
retained earnings, as applicable.

Pursuant to recent share repurchase programs, shares repurchased were
immediately retired, and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The
Company's policy related to these share repurchases is to reduce its common
stock based on the par value of the shares repurchased and to reduce its
additional paid-in capital for the excess of the repurchase price over the par
value.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Regions sponsors stock plans which most commonly include restricted stock
(i.e., unvested common stock) units, restricted stock awards, performance
stock units and stock options. The Company accounts for share-based payments
under the fair value recognition provisions whereby compensation cost is
measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date and
is recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for service-based awards. The fair
value of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or performance stock
units is determined based on the closing price of Regions common stock on the
date of grant. Historical data is also used to estimate future employee
attrition, which is considered in calculating estimated forfeitures. Estimated
forfeitures are adjusted when actual forfeitures differ from estimates,
resulting in the recognition of compensation cost only for awards that vest.
The effect of a change in estimated forfeitures is recognized through a
cumulative catch-up adjustment that is included in compensation cost in the
period of the change in estimate. The fair value of stock options where
vesting is based on service is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model and related assumptions. As compensation cost is
recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of
the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time
the share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, have expired, or restrictions
are released, the Company may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax
expense depending on the market price of the Company's common stock.

See Note 17 for further discussion and details of share-based payments.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Regions uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market
value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flows
during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension
plan assets. At a minimum, amortization of the net gain or loss included in
accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from experience different
from that assumed and from changes in assumptions is included as a component
of net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, that net
gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market value of plan assets. If amortization is required,
the minimum amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining
service period of active participating employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. Regions records the service cost component of net periodic
pension and postretirement benefit cost in salaries and employee benefits on
the consolidated statements of income. The other components of net periodic
pension and postretirement benefit cost are recorded in other non-interest
expense on the consolidated statements of income. Regions uses a third-party
actuary to compute the remaining service period of active participating
employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality,
and other applicable employee demographics.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Interest Income

The largest source of revenue for Regions is interest income. Interest income
is recognized using the interest method driven by nondiscretionary formulas
based on written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund fees and other
service charges. Non-sufficient fund fees are earned when a depositor presents
an item for payment in excess of available funds, and Regions, at its
discretion, provides the necessary funds to complete the transaction.

Regions generates other service charges by providing depositors proper
safeguard and remittance of funds as well as by providing optional services
for depositors, such as check imaging or treasury management, that are
performed upon the depositor's request. Charges for the proper safeguard and
remittance of funds are recognized monthly, as the customer retains funds in
the account. Regions recognizes revenue for other optional services at the
point in time the customer uses the selected service to execute a transaction
(e.g. execute an ACH wire).

Card and ATM Fees

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card, debit card, and
ATM related revenue. The majority of the fees are card interchange where
Regions earns a fee for remitting cardholder funds (or extends credit) via a
third party network to

  

104

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

merchants. Regions satisfies performance obligations for each transaction at
the point in time the card is used and the funds are remitted. The network
establishes interchange fees that the merchant remits to Regions for each
transaction, and Regions incurs costs from the network for facilitating the
interchange with the merchant. Due to its inability to establish prices and
direct activities of the related processing network's service, Regions is
deemed the agent in this arrangement and records interchange revenues net of
related costs. Regions also pays consideration to certain commercial card
holders based on interchange fees and contractual volume. These costs are
recognized as a reduction to interchange income.

Card and ATM fees also include ATM fee income generated from allowing a
Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a non-Regions ATM and from allowing
a non-Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a Regions ATM. Regions
satisfies performance obligations for each transaction at the point in time
that the withdrawal is processed. Regions does not direct activities of the
related processing network's service and recognizes revenue on a net basis as
the agent in each transaction.

Investment Management and Trust Fee Income

Investment management and trust fee income represents revenue generated from
asset management services provided to individuals, businesses, and
institutions. Regions has a fiduciary responsibility to the beneficiary of the
trust to perform agreed upon services which can include investing the assets,
periodic reporting to the beneficiaries, and providing tax information
regarding the trust. In exchange for these trust and custodial services,
Regions collects fee income from beneficiaries as contractually determined via
fee schedules. Regions' performance obligations to customers are primarily
satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the
customer.

Mortgage Income

Mortgage income and related fees are recognized when earned as Regions
services mortgage loans for others. Mortgage income also includes gains or
losses on Regions' sales of mortgage loans to other financial institutions or
government agencies which are recognized as each sales transaction occurs.

Capital Markets Income

Regions generates capital markets fee revenue through capital raising
activities which include revenue streams such as securities underwriting and
placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange,
derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. For those
revenue streams, revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time which
coincides with the satisfaction of a single performance obligation, typically
the transaction closing.

Securities underwriting and placement fees involve the issuing and
distribution of securities for an underwriting fee from customers. The
underwriting fee is a single performance obligation which is satisfied at the
time that the transaction is closed, and the amount of the fee is either a
fixed or variable percentage based on the deal value which is determinable at
the time of deal closing.

Regions generates revenue from affordable housing investments through the
syndication of investment funds to third parties. Regions transfers the
primary benefits of the investment to the customer and recognizes syndication
revenue on the closing date of the transaction.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance

Bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the
appreciation of cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the
proceeds of insurance benefits. Regions recognizes revenue each period in the
amount of the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the insurance
policies. Revenue from the proceeds of insurance benefits is recognized at the
time a claim is confirmed.

Commercial Credit Fee Income

Commercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and unused
commercial commitment fees. Regions recognizes revenue for letters of credit
fees over time. Regions recognizes revenue for unused commercial commitment
fees on the date that the commitment expires.

Investment Services Fee Income

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment
advisory services. Through the use of third party carriers, Regions provides
its customers with access to investment products that meet customers'
financial needs and investment objectives. Upon selection of an investment
product, the customer enters into a policy with the carrier. Regions'
performance obligation is satisfied by fulfilling its responsibility to place
customers in investment vehicles for which Regions earns commissions from the
carrier based on agreed-upon fee percentages. In addition, Regions has a
contractual relationship with a third party broker dealer to provide full
service brokerage and investment advisory activities. As the principal in the
arrangement, Regions recognizes the investment services commissions on a gross
basis.

Insurance Proceeds

Insurance proceeds represent settlements from previously disclosed lawsuits.
Revenue from insurance proceeds is recognized when the settlement proceeds are
received.

Securities Gains (Losses), Net

Net securities gains or losses result from Regions' asset/liability management
process. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized as each
sales transaction occurs with the cost of securities sold based on the
specific identification method.

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets

Regions holds assets for certain employee benefit assets, both defined and
other. Those assets are recorded at estimated fair value and the market value
variations are recognized each period.

Other Miscellaneous Income

Other miscellaneous income represents a variety of revenue streams, including
check order fees, wire transfer fees and other unusual gains, if any. For
check order fees, Regions generates revenue by serving as the agent in
connecting the customer to a third party check provider. For wire transfer
fees, Regions generates revenue by providing wire transfer services to its
depositors. In both instances Regions recognizes revenue at the time the
service is provided.

PER SHARE AMOUNTS

Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated
by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the effect
of outstanding stock options, restricted and performance stock awards if
dilutive. Refer to Note 16 for additional information.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value guidance establishes a framework for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities and defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as
opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to
assume the liability (an entry price). A fair value measure should reflect the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular
valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an
asset and the risk of nonperformance. Required disclosures include
stratification of balance sheet amounts measured at fair value based on inputs
the Company uses to derive fair value measurements. These strata include:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for
identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include
exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume),  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for
similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation
techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market,
and  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based
techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but
observable based on Company-specific data. These unobservable assumptions
reflect the Company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically
include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or
liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or
liability.  
  
ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

Debt securities available for sale, certain mortgage loans held for sale,
marketable equity securities, residential MSRs, derivative assets and
derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Below
is a description of valuation methodologies for these assets and liabilities.

Debt securities available for sale consist of U.S. Treasuries, obligations of
states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities (including
agency securities), and other debt securities.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

U.S. Treasuries are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets
on active exchanges. Pricing received for U.S. Treasuries from third-party
services is based on a market approach using dealer quotes from multiple
active market makers and real-time trading systems. These valuations are Level
1 measurements.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Mortgage-backed securities are valued primarily using data from third-party
pricing services for similar securities as applicable. Pricing from these
third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable
inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes,
benchmark securities, TBA prices, issuer spreads, bids and offers, monthly
payment information, and collateral performance, as applicable. These
valuations are Level 2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not
available, the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not
readily observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3
measurements.  
  
|  
---|---

|

Obligations of states and political subdivisions are generally based on data
from third-party pricing services. The valuations are based on a market
approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, MSRB reported
trades, material event notices and new issue data. These valuations are Level
2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not available,

the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily
observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3 measurements.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Other debt securities are valued based on Level 1, 2 and 3 measurements,
depending on pricing methodology selected and are valued primarily using data
from third-party pricing services. Pricing from these third-party services is
generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark
securities, bids and offers, and TRACE reported trades.  
  
The majority of Regions' debt securities available for sale are valued using
third-party pricing services. To validate pricing related to liquid investment
securities, which represent the vast majority of the available for sale
portfolio (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), Regions compares price changes
received from the third-party pricing service to overall changes in market
factors in order to validate the pricing received. To validate pricing
received on less liquid investment securities in the available for sale
portfolio, Regions receives pricing from third-party brokers/dealers on a
sample of securities that are then compared to the pricing received. The
pricing service uses standard observable inputs when available, for example:
benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads,
benchmark securities, and bids and offers, among others. For certain security
types, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. It
is not customary for Regions to adjust the pricing received for the available
for sale portfolio. In the event that prices are adjusted, Regions classifies
the measurement as a Level 3 measurement.

Mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential first mortgage loans and
commercial mortgages held for sale. Regions has elected to measure certain
residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value by
applying the fair value option (see additional discussion under the "Fair
Value Option" section in Note 22). The residential first mortgage loans held
for sale are valued based on traded market prices of similar assets where
available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing value and market conditions,
a Level 2 measurement. The commercial mortgage loans held for sale are valued
based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed
securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements
of interest rates and credit spreads, a Level 3 measurement due to the
unobservable inputs included in the credit spreads for bonds in commercial
mortgage-backed securitizations.

Marketable equity securities, which primarily consist of assets held for
certain employee benefits and money market funds, are valued based on quoted
market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are
Level 1 measurements.

Residential mortgage servicing rights are valued using an option-adjusted
spread valuation approach, a Level 3 measurement. The underlying assumptions
and estimated values are corroborated at least quarterly by values received
from independent third parties. See Note 7 for information regarding the
servicing of financial assets and additional details regarding the assumptions
relevant to this valuation.

Derivative assets and liabilities, which primarily consist of interest rate,
foreign exchange, and commodity contracts that include forwards, futures,
options and swaps, are included in other assets and other liabilities (as
applicable) on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest rate swaps are
predominantly traded in over-the-counter markets and, as such, values are
determined using widely accepted discounted cash flow models, which are Level
2 measurements. These discounted cash flow models use projections of future
cash payments/receipts that are discounted at an appropriate index rate.
Regions utilizes OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation
of interest rate and commodity derivatives. The projected future cash flows
are sourced from an assumed yield curve, which is consistent with industry
standards and conventions. These valuations are adjusted for the unsecured
credit risk at the reporting date, which considers collateral posted and the
impact of master netting agreements. For options and futures contracts traded
in over-the-counter markets, values are determined using discounted cash flow
analyses and option pricing models based on market rates and volatilities,
which are Level 2 measurements. Interest rate lock commitments on loans
intended for sale and risk participations categorized as credit derivatives
are valued using option pricing models that incorporate significant
unobservable inputs, and therefore are Level 3 measurements.

ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS

From time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a non-
recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically are a
result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a
write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an
asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered to be
at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. In periods where
there is no adjustment, the asset is generally not considered to be at fair
value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Foreclosed property and other real estate is carried in other assets at the
lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less estimated
costs to sell the property. The fair value for foreclosed property that is
based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally
committed sale prices is classified as a Level 2 measurement. If no formally
committed sale price is available, Regions also obtains valuations from
professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers. Updated
valuations are obtained on at least an annual basis. Foreclosed property
exceeding established dollar thresholds is valued based on appraisals.
Appraisals are performed by third-parties with appropriate professional
certifications and conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as
evidenced by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.
Regions' policies related to appraisals conform to regulations established by
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and

  

107

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

other regulatory guidance. Professional valuations are considered Level 2
measurements because they are based largely on observable inputs. Regions has
a centralized appraisal review function that is responsible for reviewing
appraisals for compliance with banking regulations and guidelines as well as
appraisal standards. Based on these reviews, Regions may make adjustments to
the market value conclusions determined in the appraisals of real estate
(either as other real estate or loans held for sale) when the appraisal review
function determines that the valuation is based on inappropriate assumptions
or where the conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the market data
presented in the appraisal. Adjustments to the market value conclusions are
discussed with the professional valuation experts and/or third-party
appraisers; the magnitude of the adjustments that are not mutually agreed upon
is insignificant. In either event, adjustments, if made, must be based on
sufficient information available to support an alternate opinion of market
value. An estimated standard discount factor, which is updated at least
annually, is applied to the appraisal amount for certain commercial and
investor real estate properties when the recorded investment in the loan is
transferred into foreclosed property. Internally adjusted valuations are
considered Level 3 measurements as management uses assumptions that may not be
observable in the market. These non-recurring fair value measurements are
typically recorded on the date an updated offered quote, appraisal, or third-
party valuation is received.

Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are adjusted
prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price transaction for
a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs; these valuations are
Level 3 measurements.

Loans held for sale for which the fair value option has not been elected are
recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at
fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair values for commercial loans held
for sale that are based on formally committed loan sale prices or valuations
performed using observable inputs are classified as a Level 2 measurement. If
no formally committed sales price is available, a professional valuation is
obtained, consistent with the process described above for foreclosed property
and other real estate.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
fair values of financial instruments that are not disclosed above:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets and cash flows approximate the estimated fair values. Because
these amounts generally relate to either currency or highly liquid assets,
these are considered Level 1 valuations.

Debt securities held to maturity: The fair values of debt securities held to
maturity are estimated in the same manner as the corresponding debt securities
available for sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Loans, (excluding capital leases), net of unearned income and allowance for
loan losses: A discounted cash flow method under the income approach is
utilized to estimate the fair value of the loan portfolio. The discounted cash
flow method relies upon assumptions about the amount and timing of scheduled
principal and interest payments, principal prepayments, and current market
rates. The loan portfolio is aggregated into categories based on loan type and
credit quality. For each loan category, weighted average statistics, such as
coupon rate, age, and remaining term are calculated. These are Level 3
valuations.

Other earning assets (excluding equity investments and operating leases): The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the
estimated fair values. While these instruments are not actively traded in the
market, the majority of the inputs required to value them are actively quoted
and can be validated through external sources. Accordingly, these are Level 2
valuations.

Deposits: The fair value of non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-
bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and
certain other time deposit accounts is the amount payable on demand at the
reporting date (i.e., the carrying amount). Fair values for certificates of
deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market
spreads to benchmark rates. These are Level 2 valuations.

Short-term and long-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of short-term
borrowings reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the
estimated fair values, and are considered Level 2 measurements as similar
instruments are traded in active markets. The fair values of certain long-term
borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments
in active markets and are considered Level 1 measurements. The fair values of
certain long term borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of
identical instruments in non-active markets and are considered Level 2
valuations. Otherwise, valuations are based on non-binding broker quotes and
are considered Level 3 valuations.

Loan commitments and letters of credit: The estimated fair values for these
off-balance sheet instruments are based on probabilities of funding to project
future loan fundings, which are discounted using the loan methodology
described above. The premiums/discounts are adjusted for the time value of
money over the average remaining life of the commitments and the opportunity
cost associated with regulatory requirements. Because the probabilities of
funding and loan valuations are not observable in the market and are
considered Company specific inputs, these are Level 3 valuations.

See Note 22 for additional information related to fair value measurements.

ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedience  
  
ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers

|

This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,
Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
Industry topics of the Codification. The core principle of the ASU is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
ASU may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective
basis.  

|

January 1, 2018  
  

|

Regions adopted the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018 using
the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately $1.7
billion of non-interest income is within the scope of the new revenue
recognition standard and includes service charges on deposit accounts, card
and ATM fees, investment management and trust fee income, capital markets fee
income, investment services fee income and other components within non-
interest income. Income streams that are out of scope of the new standard
include interest income, mortgage income, securities gains (losses), bank-
owned life insurance and certain other components within non-interest income.
Regions also developed additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures
required by the new revenue recognition standard. See Note 25.

ASU 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments  
  
ASU 2018-04, Debt Securities and Regulated Operations

|

This ASU amends ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments-Overall, and addresses
certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
financial instruments. Among other minor amendments applicable to Regions, the
main provisions require investments in equity securities to be measured at
fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income unless
they qualify for a practicability exception (excludes investments accounted
for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in
consolidation of the investee). Except for disclosure requirements that have
been adopted prospectively, the ASU must be adopted on a modified
retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2018  
  
  

|

The adoption of this guidance resulted in trading account assets and equity
securities available for sale being reclassified to other earning assets. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. See Note 8.  
  
  
  
ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

|

This ASU amends Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and provides clarification
with respect to classification within the statement of cash flows where
current guidance is unclear or silent. The ASU must be adopted
retrospectively.  

|

January 1, 2018

|

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.  
  
  
  
ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business  

|

This ASU amends Topic 805, Business Combinations, and provides additional
accounting guidance to better determine when a set of assets and activities is
a business. The ASU must be adopted prospectively.

|

January 1, 2018  
  

|

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.  
  
  
  
ASU 2017-05, Other Income- Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of
Nonfinancial Assets

|

This ASU amends Subtopic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the
Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets, to clarify the scope and to add guidance
for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The new standard adds a definition
for in-substance nonfinancial assets and clarifies that nonfinancial assets
within a legal entity are within the scope of ASC 606. This ASU may be adopted
either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2018  
  

|

Regions adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.

ASU 2017-07, Compensation- Retirement Benefits  

|

This ASU amends Topic 715, Retirement Benefits, and provides more prescriptive
guidance around the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement
benefit cost in the income statement. The amendment requires that the service
cost component be disaggregated from other components of net periodic benefit
cost in the income statement. The ASU must be adopted retrospectively.

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. See Note 18.  
  
ASU 2017-09, Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting

|

This ASU amends Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, and clarifies when
modification accounting should be applied to changes in terms or conditions of
share-based payment awards. The amendments narrow the scope of modification
accounting by clarifying that modification accounting should be applied to
awards if the change affects the fair value, vesting conditions, or
classification of the award. The amendments do not impact current disclosure
requirements for modifications, regardless of whether modification accounting
is required under the new guidance. The ASU must be adopted prospectively to
modifications that occur on or after the adoption date.

January 1, 2018  
  

|

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.  
  
  
  
ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities  

|

This ASU amends ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging to (1) improve the
transparency and understandability of information conveyed to financial
statement users about an entity's risk management activities by better
aligning the entity's financial reporting for hedging relationships with those
risk management activities and (2) reduce the complexity of and simplify the
application of hedge accounting by preparers. Except for disclosure
requirements that have been adopted prospectively, the ASU must be adopted on
a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2019  
  
Early adoption is permitted.  

|

Regions elected to adopt this ASU for financial reporting as of January 1,
2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. See Note
21.  
  
  
  
ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes  

|

This ASU amends SEC guidance in the Codification related to income taxes to
reflect the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which provides
guidance for companies that are not able to complete their accounting for the
income tax effects of the Tax Reform in the period of enactment. The staff
believes that to the extent a company can reasonably estimate the impact of
the Tax Reform, such items should be reported in the first reporting period in
which the Company is able to determine the reasonable estimate.

|

Effective upon issuance.  

|

Regions adopted this ASU upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not
have a material impact.  
  
  
ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement  
  
  

|

This ASU amends the disclosure requirements of Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement, to remove disclosure of transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of
the fair value hierarchy and to include disclosure of the range and weighted
average used in Level 3 fair value measurements, among other amendments. The
ASU applies to all entities that are required to provide disclosures about
recurring or non-recurring fair value measurements. Amendments should be
applied retrospectively to all periods presented, except for certain
amendments, which should be applied prospectively for only the most recent
interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption.

|

January 1, 2020

  

Early adoption is permitted.

|

Regions elected to adopt this ASU for financial reporting as of December 31,
2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact.  
  
  
ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits

|

This ASU amends the disclosure requirements in Topic 715, Retirement Benefits.
The ASU applies to all employer entities that sponsor defined benefit pension
or other post-retirement plans. Applicable disclosure changes include: the
removal of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next year; the
removal of the effects of a one-percentage point change in assumed health care
cost trend rates; and the addition of an explanation of reasons for
significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for
the period. The ASU must be adopted on a retrospective basis.

ASU 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors

|

This ASU creates ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The
new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding liability equal to the present value of future rental payments
on their balance sheets for all leases with a term greater than one year.
There are not significant changes to lessor accounting; however, there were
certain improvements made to align lessor accounting with the lessee
accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This
guidance expands both quantitative and qualitative required disclosures. This
ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2019

|

Regions adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition
method, which allowed for a modified retrospective method of adoption with a
cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings without restating comparable
periods. Regions also elected the relief package of practical expedients for
which there is no requirement to reassess existence of leases, their
classification, and initial direct costs as well as an exemption for short-
term leases with a term of less than one year, whereby Regions does not
recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet but
instead recognizes lease payments as an expense over the lease term as
appropriate. The adoption of this guidance resulted in recognition of a $451
million right of use asset and related liability for future lease obligations.
The adoption of the standard is expected to have an immaterial impact to the
consolidated statements of income.

  
  
  
ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

  

ASU 2018-19 Codification Improvements to Topic 326

|

This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses to replace the
current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss
approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other
commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all
available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect
the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to
collect. The amendments also eliminate the current accounting model for
purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Additional quantitative
and qualitative disclosures are required upon adoption.  
  
While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the
ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit
losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized
cost of the securities by direct write-offs.  
  
The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Entities that
have loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should
prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit
deteriorated assets.

|

January 1, 2020

|

Regions' cross-functional implementation team, which is co-led by Finance and
Risk Management, has developed a project plan that results in running a CECL
parallel production during 2019 and the adoption of the standard in the first
quarter of 2020. Key project implementation activities for 2018 focused on
model enhancements, continued challenge of model outputs, initial development
of the qualitative framework, establishing processes and controls, drafting
policies and disclosures, data resolution, and documentation. Key project
implementation activities for 2019 include finalization of models, the
qualitative framework, and the production process; completion of
documentation, policies and disclosures; development of supporting analytics;
and process and control testing. The project implementation plan also
establishes a parallel processing timeline which begins with a limited
parallel run in the first quarter of 2019. Parallel runs will be enhanced
throughout the year to include the end-to-end production process, governance,
controls and disclosures.

Regions provides updates to senior leadership and to the Audit Committee and
Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These communications provide an
update on the status of the implementation project plan, results of initial
modeled impacts, and any identified risks.

Adoption of the standard may result in an overall material increase in the
allowance for credit losses given the change from accounting for losses
inherent in the loan portfolio to accounting for losses over the remaining
contractual life of the portfolio. However, the impact at adoption will be
influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as
well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. Based on initial
modeling, the consumer loan portfolios are expected to generate the majority
of the increase including longer-dated loans such as residential first
mortgages, and home equity lending products and indirect-other products.
Additionally, there could be increases or decreases in the allowance in
certain other loan portfolios at adoption.

Regions expects no material allowance on held to maturity securities because
most of this portfolio consists of agency-backed securities that inherently
have an immaterial risk of loss. Additionally, Regions expects no material
impact to available for sale securities.

ASU 2017-08, Receivables- Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

|

This ASU amends Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other
Costs, to shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt
securities held at a premium to the earliest call date. Current guidance
generally requires entities to amortize a premium as a yield adjustment over
the contractual life of the instrument. Shortening the amortization period is
generally expected to more closely align the recognition of interest income
with expectations incorporated into the pricing of the underlying securities.
The amendments do not affect the accounting treatment of discounts. This ASU
should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

The FASB issued this ASU to clarify, improve, and correct errors in the
Codification. The ASU covers nine amendments, which affect a wide variety of
Topics including business combinations, debt, derivatives and hedging, and
defined contribution pension plans. Some amendments do not require transition
guidance and are effective upon issuance, while others will be applicable for
Regions starting in 2019. However, all amendments are expected to have an
immaterial impact to Regions.

Software, regarding a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and
other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is hosted
by the vendor, i.e. a service contract. Customers will apply the same criteria
for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that
has a software license. The amendments also prescribe the balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized
implementation costs and related amortization expense, and require additional
quantitative and qualitative disclosures.

benchmark interest rates permitted in applying hedge accounting. The
amendments permit all entities that elect to apply hedge accounting to
benchmark interest rate hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to use
the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate in addition
to the four eligible U.S. benchmark interest rates. The amendments should be
applied prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships
entered into on or after the date of adoption.

NOTE 2. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Regions is involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs, as
defined by authoritative accounting literature. Generally, a VIE is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other legal structure that either does not
have equity investors with substantive voting rights or has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support
its activities. The following discusses the VIEs in which Regions has a
significant interest.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt
and equity. These partnerships meet the definition of a VIE. Regions uses the
proportional amortization method to account for these investments. Due to the
nature of the management activities of the general partner, Regions is not the
primary beneficiary of these partnerships. See Note 1 for additional details.
Additionally, Regions has loans or letters of credit commitments with certain
limited partnerships. The funded portion of the loans and letters of credit
are classified as commercial and industrial loans or investor real estate
loans as applicable in Note 5.

A summary of Regions' affordable housing tax credit investments and related
loans and letters of credit, representing Regions' maximum exposure to loss as
of December 31 is as follows:

In addition to the investments discussed above, Regions also syndicates
affordable housing investments. In these syndication transactions, Regions
creates affordable housing funds in which a subsidiary is the general partner
or managing member and sells limited partnership interests to third parties.
Regions' general partner or managing member interest represents an
insignificant interest in the affordable housing fund. The affordable housing
funds meet the definition of a VIE. As Regions is not the primary beneficiary
and does not have a significant interest, these investments are not
consolidated. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the value of Regions' general
partnership interest in affordable housing investments was immaterial.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

Other investments determined to be VIEs include investments in CRA projects,
SBICs, and other miscellaneous investments. A summary of Regions' equity

NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&T Insurance
Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. The gain associated
with the transaction amounted to $281 million ($196 million after-tax).

In connection with the agreement, the results of the entities sold are
reported in the Company's consolidated statements of income separately as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell
Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The transaction closed
on April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. (formerly known as
Morgan Asset Management, Inc.) and Regions Trust were not included in the
sale. In connection with the closing of the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify
Raymond James for all litigation matters related to pre-closing activities.
See Note 24 for related disclosure.

The gross unrealized losses recognized in OCI on securities held to maturity
resulted from a transfer of securities available for sale to held to maturity
in the second quarter of 2013.  
  
Debt securities with carrying values of $7.9 billion and $8.1 billion at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds,
trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements. Included within total
pledged securities is approximately $24 million and $50 million of encumbered
U.S. Treasury securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at December 31, 2018, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The following tables present gross unrealized losses and the related estimated
fair value of debt securities held to maturity and debt securities available
for sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For debt securities transferred to
held to maturity from available for sale, the analysis in the tables below is
comparing the securities' original amortized cost to its current estimated
fair value. These securities are segregated between investments that have been
in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for
twelve months or more.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above increased from 1,059 at December 31, 2017 to 1,379 at December
31, 2018. The increase in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in market interest rates. In
instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication of an
adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables above. As
it relates to these positions, management believes no individual unrealized
loss, other than those discussed below, represented an OTTI as of those dates.
The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of
their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating OTTI, management did
identify a limited number of positions where an OTTI was believed to exist
during 2018. For the year ended 2018, such impairments were immaterial.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale from continuing operations are shown in the table below.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Loans are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums
and net deferred loan costs of $(4) million and $43 million at December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively.  
  
During 2018 and 2017, Regions purchased approximately $503 million and $238
million in indirect-other consumer loans from third parties, respectively.

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending
business due to competition-based margin compression impacting overall returns
on the portfolio. Regions will cease originating new indirect auto loans in
the first quarter of 2019 and intends to complete any in-process indirect auto
loan closings by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will
remain in the direct auto lending business.

At December 31, 2018, $22.0 billion in securities and net eligible loans held
by Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the
FHLB. At December 31, 2018, an additional $25.0 billion in net eligible loans
held by Regions were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

The following tables include details regarding Regions' investment in
leveraged leases included within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio
class as of and for the years ended December 31:

million, $1 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016, respectively. Pre-tax income from leveraged leases was reduced
by $6 million during 2017 as a result of Tax Reform.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by
portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The
total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances
are disaggregated to detail the amounts derived through individual evaluation
and collective evaluation for impairment. The allowance for loan losses
related to individually evaluated loans is attributable to reserves for non-
accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs. The allowance
for loan losses and the loan portfolio ending balances related to collectively
evaluated loans is attributable to the remainder of the portfolio.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the
portfolio segments.

Commercial--The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and
industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations
to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion
projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term

financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness
of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers' business
operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in commodity prices.

Investor Real Estate--Loans for real estate development are repaid through
cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This
portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or
investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income
generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real
estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product
types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions' markets.
Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such
as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping
centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the
valuation of real estate.

Consumer--The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage,
home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card,
and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to
consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15
to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their
primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and
lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second
mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the
equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or
line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in
addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses.
Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale
lending through third parties. Consumer credit card lending includes Regions
branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer loans include other
revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in
this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer
economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are detailed by
categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default.
Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the
relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis
or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the
borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories
are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Pass--includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Special Mention--includes obligations that have potential weakness that may,
if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the
Company's position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also
be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an
adverse effect on debt service ability;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Substandard Accrual--includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness
that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently
performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility
that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not
corrected;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Non-accrual--includes obligations where management has determined that full
payment of principal and interest is in doubt.  
  
Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to
as "classified." Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans
are often collectively referred to as "criticized and classified." Classes in
the consumer portfolio segment are disaggregated by accrual status.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Typical modifications include
accommodations, such as renewals and forbearances. The majority of Regions'
commercial and investor real estate TDRs are the result of renewals of
classified loans at an interest rate that is not considered to be a market
interest rate. For smaller dollar commercial loans, Regions may periodically
grant interest rate and other term concessions, similar to those under the
consumer program described below.

Regions works to meet the individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem
foreclosure through its CAP. Regions designed the program to allow for
customer-tailored modifications with the goal of keeping customers in their
homes and avoiding foreclosure where possible. Modification may be offered to
any borrower experiencing financial hardship regardless of the borrower's
payment status. Consumer TDRs primarily involve an interest rate concession,
however under the CAP, Regions may also offer a short-term deferral, a term
extension, a new loan product, or a combination of these options. For loans
restructured under the CAP, Regions expects to collect the original
contractually due principal. The gross original contractual interest may be
collectible, depending on the terms modified. All CAP modifications are
considered TDRs regardless of the term because they are concessionary in
nature and because the customer documents a financial hardship in order to
participate.

As noted above, the majority of Regions' TDRs are results of interest rate
concessions and not a forgiveness of principal. Accordingly, the financial
impact of the modifications is best illustrated by the impact to the allowance
calculation at the loan or pool level, as a result of the loans being
considered impaired due to their TDR status. Regions most often does not
record a charge-off at the modification date.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs. Loans first reported as
TDRs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately $374
million and $501 million, respectively.

Defaulted TDRs

The following table presents, by portfolio segment and class, TDRs that
defaulted during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and that were
modified in the previous twelve months (i.e., the twelve months prior to the
default). For purposes of this disclosure, default is defined as placement on
non-accrual status for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio
segments, and 90 days past due and still accruing for the consumer portfolio
segment. Consideration of defaults in the calculation of the allowance for
loan losses is described in detail in Note 1.

Commercial and investor real estate loans that were on non-accrual status at
the time of the latest modification are not included in the default table
above, as they are already considered to be in default at the time of the
restructuring. At December 31, 2018, approximately $42 million of commercial
and investor real estate loans modified in a TDR during the year ended
December 31, 2018 were on non-accrual status.

At December 31, 2018, Regions had restructured binding unfunded commitments
totaling $8 million where a concession was granted and the borrower was in
financial difficulty.

NOTE 7. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method for the years ended December 31:

"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns.  
  
In 2016, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $7.6
billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $69 million.

In 2017, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $2.7
billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $30 million.

In 2018, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $6.1
billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $77 million.
Approximately $7 million of the purchase price will be paid in 2019.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 for additional information. Also see
Note 24 for additional information related to the guarantee.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the DUS servicing portfolio was
approximately $3.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The related
commercial MSRs were approximately $56 million and $48 million at December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The estimated fair value of the loss share
guarantee was approximately $4 million at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.

NOTE 8. OTHER EARNING ASSETS

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB
stock, marketable equity securities, and operating lease assets.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

Effective January 1, 2018, Regions adopted new accounting guidance that
requires equity investments to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in net income. See Note 1 for related disclosure.

Marketable equity securities carried at fair value, which primarily consist of
assets held for certain employee benefits and money market funds, are reported
in other earning assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Total marketable
equity securities were $429 million and $414 million at December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively. Losses recognized in earnings for marketable equity
securities still being held by the Company at December 31, 2018 were $11
million.

The goodwill allocated to the Wealth Management reportable segment decreased
in 2018 due to the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. See Note 3 for more
information related to this transaction.

Regions assessed the indicators of goodwill impairment for all three reporting
units as part of its annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2018, and
through the date of the filing of this Annual Report, by performing a
qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In performing
the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances
since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including
reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory
actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific
factors and trends in the banking industry. The results of the qualitative
assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair
value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the test date;
therefore, the quantitative goodwill impairment tests were deemed unnecessary.

As of December 31, 2018, Regions had three issuances and Regions Bank had one
issuance of subordinated notes totaling $555 million and $495 million,
respectively, with stated interest rates ranging from 6.45% to 7.75%. All
issuances of these notes are, by definition, subordinated and subject in right
of payment of both principal and interest to the prior payment in full of all
senior indebtedness of the Company, which is generally defined as all
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its creditors, except
subordinated indebtedness. Payment of the principal of the notes may be
accelerated only in the case of certain events involving bankruptcy,
insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the Company. The subordinated
notes described above qualify as Tier 2 capital under Federal Reserve
guidelines, subject to diminishing credit as the respective maturity dates
approach and subject to certain transition provisions. None of the
subordinated notes are redeemable prior to maturity, unless there is an
occurrence of a qualifying capital event.

During 2018, Regions issued $500 million of senior notes, and simultaneously
entered into an interest rate swap effectively converting the notes to
floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR. Regions also had $100 million of senior
notes mature during 2018.

Also in 2018, Regions Bank issued $1.9 billion of senior notes. These senior
notes included an issuance of $550 million of 2.75% senior notes, which were
effectively converted to floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR through the
simultaneous execution of an interest rate swap. Regions Bank also redeemed
$750 million of senior notes and had $500 million of subordinated notes mature
during 2018.

FHLB advances at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 had a weighted-average
interest rate of 2.6 percent, 1.4 percent, and 0.8 percent, respectively, with
remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to twelve years and a
weighted-average of 0.9 years. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent upon the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions has pledged certain loans as
collateral for the FHLB advances outstanding. See Note 5 for loans pledged to
the FHLB at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Additionally, membership in the FHLB
requires an institution to hold FHLB stock. See Note 8 for the amount of FHLB
stock held at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Regions' total borrowing capacity
with the FHLB (including outstanding advances) as of December 31, 2018, based
on assets available for collateral at that date, was approximately $17.2
billion.

Regions uses derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage
interest rate risk by converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a
variable-rate. The effective rate adjustments related to these hedges are
included in interest expense on long-term borrowings. The weighted-average
interest rate on total long-term debt, including the effect of derivative
instruments, was 3.2 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.4 percent for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Further discussion of
derivative instruments is included in Note 21.

The aggregate amount of contractual maturities of all long-term debt in each
of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

In February 2016, Regions filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC.
This shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by
Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. The registration
statement will expire in February 2019. Regions expects to file a new shelf
registration statement on or about February 22, 2019.

Regions Bank may issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank
note program or as stand-alone issuances. Notes issued by Regions Bank may be
senior or subordinated notes. Notes issued by Regions Bank are not deposits
and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions. Regulatory approval would be required
for retirement of some securities.

On January 28, 2019, through a reopening of its 3.80% senior notes due August
2023, Regions issued $500 million of senior notes, which were effectively
converted to floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR through the simultaneous
execution of an interest rate swap.

NOTE 14. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions. Banking regulations identify five capital categories: well-
capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2018 and
2017, Regions and Regions Bank exceeded all current regulatory requirements,
and were classified as "well-capitalized." Management believes that no events
or changes have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2018 that would change
this designation.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require institutions to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier
1, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets
(as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (the "Leverage"
ratio).

(1) The 2018 and 2017 capital ratios were calculated at different points of
the phase-in period under the Basel III Rules and therefore are not directly
comparable.

(2) The 2018 Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and
Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

Substantially all net assets are owned by subsidiaries. The primary source of
operating cash available to Regions is provided by dividends from
subsidiaries. Statutory limits are placed on the amount of dividends the
subsidiary bank can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition,
regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum capital-to-asset
ratios at banking subsidiaries. Under the Federal Reserve's Regulation H,
Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay
a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar
year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank's net income for that year and (b)
its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any
required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the
retirement of preferred stock. Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a
dividend to Regions in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until the
bank's surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. Regions Bank is
also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama
Superintendent of Banking prior to paying a dividend to Regions if the total
of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the
total of (a) Regions Bank's net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained
net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus. The statute defines net earnings as "the remainder of all earnings
from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and
other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating
expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all
federal, state and local taxes." In addition to dividend restrictions, Federal
statutes also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the parent
company.

In addition, Regions must adhere to various HUD regulatory guidelines
including required minimum capital to maintain their HUD approved status.
Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this
certification. As of December 31, 2018, Regions was in compliance with HUD
guidelines. Regions is also subject to various capital requirements by
secondary market investors.

(1) Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR
plus 3.536%.

For each preferred stock issuance listed above, Regions issued depositary
shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the
Company's preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per
share of preferred stock (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share).
Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are payable
quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and
redemption is solely at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in
whole, or in part, after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in
part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event for the
Series A preferred stock or at any time following a regulatory capital
treatment event for the Series B preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared $64 million in cash dividends on preferred
stock, during both 2018 and 2017.

In the event Series A and Series B preferred shares are redeemed at the
liquidation amounts, $113 million and $67 million excess of the redemption
amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively.
Approximately $100 million of Series A preferred dividends that were recorded
as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately $13 million of related
issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to
common shareholders. Approximately $52 million of Series B preferred dividends
that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related
surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and
approximately $15 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

On June 28, 2018, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to
its 2018 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process, which
included the repurchase of common shares and a common stock dividend increase.
As part of the Company's capital plan, the Board authorized a new $2.031
billion common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the
beginning of the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.
This plan is inclusive of the capital generated from the sale of Regions
Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates (see Note 3). The capital plan
included a proposed increase of the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14
per common share that began in the third quarter of 2018.

Regions declared $0.46 per share in cash dividends for 2018, $0.315 for 2017,
and $0.255 for 2016.

As of December 31, 2018, Regions had repurchased approximately 90.4 million
shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.7 billion under
this plan. The Company continued to repurchase shares under this plan in the
first quarter of 2019, and as of February 21, 2019, Regions had additional
repurchases of approximately 7.4 million shares of common stock at a total
cost of approximately $114.0 million. All of these shares were immediately
retired upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury
stock.

Prior to the new common stock repurchase plan, Regions had authorization to
repurchase $1.47 billion in common shares. As of June 30, 2018, Regions had
repurchased approximately 90.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost
of approximately $1.47 billion under this plan and concluded the plan during
the second quarter of 2018.

Certain per share amounts may not appear to reconcile due to rounding.  
  
The effect from the assumed exercise of 6 million, 14 million and 27 million
in stock options, restricted stock units and awards and performance stock
units for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was
not included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share
because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per
common share.

NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Regions administers long-term incentive compensation plans that permit the
granting of incentive awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock
awards, performance awards and stock appreciation rights. While Regions has
the ability to issue stock appreciation rights, none have been issued to date.
The terms of all awards issued under these plans are determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board; however, no awards may be granted after
the tenth anniversary from the date the plans were initially approved by
stockholders. Incentive awards usually vest based on employee service,
generally within three years from the date of the grant. The contractual lives
of options granted under these plans are typically ten years from the date of
the grant.

On April 23, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved the Regions
Financial Corporation 2015 LTIP, which permits the Company to grant to
employees and directors various forms of incentive compensation. These forms
of incentive compensation are similar to the types of compensation approved in
prior plans. The 2015 LTIP authorizes 60 million common share equivalents
available for grant, where grants of options and grants of full value awards
(e.g., shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
stock units) count as one share equivalent. Unless otherwise determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, grants of restricted stock, restricted
stock units, and performance stock units accrue dividends, or their notional
equivalent, as they are declared by the Board, and are paid upon vesting of
the award. Upon adoption of the 2015 LTIP, Regions closed the prior long-term
incentive plan to new grants, and, accordingly, prospective grants must be
made under the 2015 LTIP or a successor plan. All existing grants under prior
long-term incentive plans are unaffected by adoption of the 2015 LTIP. The
number of remaining share equivalents available for future issuance under the
2015 LTIP was approximately 43 million at December 31, 2018.

Grants of performance-based restricted stock typically have a three-year
performance period, and shares vest within three years after the grant date.
Restricted stock units typically have a vesting period of three years.

or units must either remain employed with the Company for certain periods from
the date of grant in order for shares to be released or issued or retire after
meeting the standards of a retiree, at which time shares would be issued and
released. The terms of these plans generally stipulate that the exercise price
of options may not be less than the fair market value of Regions' common stock
at the date the options are granted. Regions issues new shares from authorized
reserves upon exercise.

The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $10 million for 2018,
$13 million for 2017, and $17 million for 2016. Cash received from options
exercised was $11 million, $8 million, and $11 million in 2018, 2017, and
2016, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions
from options exercised totaled $4 million for 2018, $3 million for 2017, and
$4 million for 2016.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, Regions made restricted stock grants that vest
upon satisfaction of service conditions and restricted stock award and
performance stock award grants that vest based upon service conditions and
performance conditions. Incremental shares earned above the performance target
associated with previous performance stock awards are included when and if
performance targets are achieved. Dividend payments during the vesting period
are deferred to the end of the vesting term. The fair value of these
restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance stock units was
estimated based upon the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of
the grant. The valuation was not adjusted for the deferral of dividends.

As of December 31, 2018, the pre-tax amount of non-vested restricted stock,
restricted stock units and performance stock units not yet recognized was $53
million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.68
years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December
31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $112 million, $68 million, and $47 million,
respectively. No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

NOTE 18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Effective January 1, 2016, Regions separated its defined benefit pension plan
qualified under the Internal Revenue Code into two plans. The new plan was
created primarily for participants who were actively employed on January 1,
2016 and all other participants were retained in the existing plan. Regions'
defined benefit pension plans cover only certain employees as the pension
plans are closed to new entrants. Benefits under the pension plans are based
on years of service and the employee's highest five consecutive years of
compensation during the last ten years of employment. Regions' funding policy
is to contribute annually at least the amount required by IRS minimum funding
standards. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the
future.

The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a non-qualified pension plan that
provides certain senior executive officers defined benefits in relation to
their compensation. Actuarially determined pension expense is charged to
current operations using the projected unit credit method. All defined benefit
plans are referred to as "the plans" throughout the remainder of this
footnote.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified plans was $1.8 billion
and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total plan
assets exceeded the corresponding accumulated benefit obligation for the
qualified plans as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The accumulated benefit
obligation for the non-qualified plans was $141 million and $143 million as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which exceeded all corresponding
plan assets for each period. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the actuarial
(gains) losses related to the change in the benefit obligation were primarily
driven by changes in the discount rate.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is recorded in
salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

The settlement charge in 2017 relates to the settlement of liabilities under
the SERP for certain plan participants.

Regions utilizes a disaggregated approach in the estimation of the service and
interest components of net periodic pension costs by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit
obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This provides a more precise
measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between
projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates.

The expected long-term rate of return on the qualified plans' assets is based
on an estimated reasonable range of probable returns. The assumption is
established by considering historical and anticipated return of the asset
classes invested in by the qualified plans and the allocation strategy
currently in place among those classes. Management chose a point within the
range based on the probability of achievement combined with incremental
returns attributable to active management. For 2019, the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is 6.84 percent.

The qualified pension plans' investment strategy is continuing to shift from
focusing on maximizing asset returns to minimizing funding ratio volatility,
with a planned increase in the allocation to bonds. The combined target asset
allocation is 51 percent equities, 37 percent fixed income securities and 12
percent in all other types of investments. Equity securities include
investments in large and small/mid cap companies primarily located in the
U.S., international equities, and private equities. Fixed income securities
include investments in corporate and government bonds, asset-backed securities
and any other fixed income investments as allowed by respective prospectuses
and other offering documents. Other types of investments may include hedge
funds and real estate funds that follow several different strategies. The
plans' assets are highly diversified with respect to asset class, security and
manager. Investment risk is controlled with the plans' assets rebalancing to
target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment
managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with
each investment manager.

Regions' qualified pension plans have a portion of their investments in
Regions' common stock. At December 31, 2018, the plans held 2,855,618 shares,
which represents a total market value of approximately $38 million, or
approximately 1.8 percent of the plans' assets.

__________

(1) In accordance with accounting guidance adopted by Regions in 2016,
investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per
share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are no longer required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in
this table are intended to permit reconciliation of amounts reported in the
fair value hierarchy to amounts reported on the balance sheet.

For all investments, the plans attempt to use quoted market prices of
identical assets on active exchanges, or Level 1 measurements. Where such
quoted market prices are not available, the plans typically employ quoted
market prices of similar instruments (including matrix pricing) and/or
discounted cash flows to estimate a value of these securities, or Level 2
measurements. Level 2 discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on
market interest rates, prepayment speeds and/or option adjusted spreads.

Investments held in the plans consist of cash and cash equivalents, fixed
income securities , equity securities, collective trust funds, hedge funds,
real estate funds, private equity and other assets and are recorded at fair
value on a recurring basis. See Note 1 for a description of valuation
methodologies related to U.S. Treasuries, federal agency securities, and
equity securities. The methodology described in Note 1 for other debt
securities is applicable to corporate bonds.

Mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on
active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. Collective trust
funds, hedge funds, real estate funds, private equity funds and other assets
are valued based on net asset value or the valuation of the limited partner's
portion of the equity of the fund. Third party fund managers provide these
valuations based primarily on estimated valuations of underlying investments.

OTHER PLANS

Regions has a defined-contribution 401(k) plan that includes a Company match
of eligible employee contributions. Eligible employees include those who have
been employed for one year and have worked a minimum of 1,000 hours. The
Company match is invested based on the employees' allocation elections. In
2018, 2017 and 2016, Regions provided an automatic 2 percent cash 401(k)
contribution to eligible employees regardless of whether or not they were
contributing to the 401(k) plan. To receive this contribution, employees must
be employed at the end of the year and not actively accruing a benefit in the
Regions' pension plans. Regions' cash contribution was approximately $18
million for both 2018 and 2017 and $17 million for 2016. Eligible employees
who are already contributing to the 401(k) plan will continue to receive up to
a 4 percent Company match plus the automatic 2 percent cash contribution.
Regions' match to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled $48 million
in both 2018 and 2017 and $45 million in 2016. Regions' 401(k) plan held 23
million shares and 26 million shares of Regions' common stock at December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The 401(k) plan received approximately $10
million, $8 million and $9 million in dividends on Regions' common stock for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2019, for eligible employees, the Company match for the
401(k) plan increased from 4 percent to 5 percent.

Regions also sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
cover certain retired employees. For these certain employees retiring before
normal retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the costs of
certain health care benefits until the retired employee becomes eligible for
Medicare. Certain retirees, participating in plans of acquired entities, are
offered a Medicare supplemental benefit. The plan is contributory and contains
other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments. Retiree
health care benefits, as well as similar benefits for active employees, are
provided through a self-insured program in which Company and retiree costs are
based on the amount of benefits paid. The Company's policy is to fund the
Company's share of the cost of health care benefits in amounts determined at
the discretion of management. Postretirement life insurance is also provided
to a grandfathered group of employees and retirees. The assumed health care
cost trend rate for postretirement medical benefits was 6.10 percent for 2018
and is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.50 percent by 2038 and remain at
that level thereafter. There was no material impact from other postretirement
benefits on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December
31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
these plans was $17 million and $19 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.

Note: The table above does not include total income tax expense (benefit) from
discontinued operations of $80 million, $(3) million, and $7 million in 2018,
2017 and 2016, respectively. The deferred income tax expense (benefit)
reflected in discontinued operations was $43 million, $(7) million and $20
million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, Tax
Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from 35
percent to 21 percent. With the enactment of Tax Reform, the Company
recognized additional income tax expense of approximately $61 million at
December 31, 2017. This amount represented an estimate based on information
available at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company made the
determination to and completed administrative filings with the Internal
Revenue Service that allowed it to accelerate various deductions into 2017. As
a result, the Company recognized during the 2018 measurement period
approximately $37 million in tax benefits due to Tax Reform. The measurement
period ended in December 2018.

Except for the revaluation adjustment recorded in 2017 due to Tax Reform
related to unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity,
income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized losses on
securities transferred to held to maturity, unrealized gains and losses on
securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivative
instruments and the net change from defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement benefits. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on
stockholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company accounts for investment tax credits using the deferral method.
Investment tax credits generated totaled $90 million, $102 million and $54
million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Income taxes from continuing operations for financial reporting purposes
differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax
rate of 21 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 35 percent for the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as shown in the following table:

________

(1) N/A indicates that credits are not measured on a pre-tax basis.

  

Of the $20 million net deferred tax asset, $60 million relates to net
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, $45 million of which expires
before 2031 (as detailed in the table above).

The Company's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset
is based on its assessment of all available positive and negative evidence. At
December 31, 2018, positive evidence supporting the realization of the
deferred tax assets includes a history of positive earnings with no history of
significant tax credit carryforwards expiring unused. In addition, the
reversal of taxable temporary differences, excluding goodwill and the
inclusion of the accretion of taxable temporary differences related to
leveraged leases acquired in a previous business combination, will offset
approximately $593 million of the gross deferred tax assets.

The Company believes that a portion of the state net operating loss
carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards will not be realized due to
the length of certain state carryforward periods. Accordingly, a valuation
allowance has been established in the amount of $30 million against such
benefits at December 31, 2018 compared to $34 million at December 31, 2017.

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns. In 2015,
the Company entered the IRS's Compliance Assurance Process program and tax
years 2017 and 2018 remain open. Other than potential adjustments related to
tax attribute carryovers, tax years prior to 2017 are no longer subject to
examination by the IRS. Also, with few exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2014.
Currently, there are no material disputed tax positions with federal or state
taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate that any
adjustments relating to federal or state tax examinations will result in
material changes to its business, financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

As a result of the potential resolution of certain federal and state income
tax positions, it is reasonably possible that the UTBs could decrease as much
as $2 million during the next twelve months, since resolved items will be
removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or
recognition in earnings.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the balance of the Company's UTBs that
would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, was $10 million, $21
million and $20 million, respectively. The remainder of the UTB balance has
indirect tax benefits in other jurisdictions or is the tax effect of temporary
differences.

Income tax expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016, includes a total expense (benefit)
of $(2) million, $(2) million and $1 million, respectively, for interest
expense, interest income and penalties before the impact of any applicable
federal and state deductions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company
had a liability of zero and $2 million, respectively, for interest and
penalties related to income taxes, before the impact of any applicable federal
and state deductions.

HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies for
derivatives is described in Note 1.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors.

Regions recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of $51 million and $147
million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively, related to discontinued cash flow hedges of loan
instruments which will be amortized into earnings in conjunction with the
recognition of interest payments through 2025. Regions recognized pre-tax
income of $45 million and $68 million during the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow
hedges of loan instruments.

Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $31 million in pre-
tax expense due to the receipt or payment of interest payments on all cash
flow hedges and interest rate within the next twelve months. Included in this
amount is $14 million in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of
discontinued cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which Regions
is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted
transactions is approximately seven years as of December 31, 2018.

The following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on
the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
December 31, 2018 and 2017, Regions had $191 million and $197 million,
respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock commitments.
Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage
loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments. Residential
mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are
recorded at the lower of cost or market or at fair value based on management's
election. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Regions had $429 million and $481
million, respectively, in total notional amount related to these forward sale
commitments. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock
commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to residential
mortgage loans are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from
both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments
related to commercial mortgage loans are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair market value with
any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Concurrent
with the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began
using various derivative

instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments, futures contracts, swaps
and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair value of its
residential MSRs on its consolidated statements of income. As of December 31,
2018 and 2017, the total notional amount related to these contracts was $5.7
billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss)
recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in
the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:

Credit risk, defined as all positive exposures not collateralized with cash or
other assets or reserved for, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, totaled
approximately $130 million and $251 million, respectively. This amount
represents the net credit risk on all trading and other derivative positions
held by Regions.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2019 and 2026.
Credit derivatives whereby Regions has sold credit protection have maturities
between 2019 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit protection,
Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if the customer
fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon early
termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of the
prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on recently
issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management practices of
unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of December 31, 2018 was approximately $529 million. This scenario would only
occur if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties
defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at December
31, 2018 and 2017 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold
credit protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap
transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings fall below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $45 million and $91 million, respectively, for
which Regions had posted collateral of $43 million and $90 million,
respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 22. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities
available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3
valuation based on management's conclusion regarding the observability of
inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if
they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.The following table presents
assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis
and non-recurring basis as of December 31:

Marketable equity securities were reclassified from trading account securities
and securities available for sale to other earning assets, beginning in the
first quarter of 2018, with the adoption of new accounting guidance. Prior

With the adoption of new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018,
equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are required to
be adjusted prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price
transaction for a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs.

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'
consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3
are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for all material assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. The net changes in realized gains (losses) included in
earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016 are not material.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 7. See Note 7 for these amounts
and additional disclosures related to assumptions used in the fair value
calculation for MSRs.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all FNMA and FHLMC eligible
residential mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated
with the intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of
the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value at December 31:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income for
the years presented. These changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic
hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to
changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
(2)

|

The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. In
the current whole loan market, financial investors are generally requiring a
higher rate of return than the return inherent in loans if held to maturity.
The fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at
December 31, 2018 was $1.7 billion or 2.1 percent.

NOTE 23. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised.

The Corporate Bank segment represents the Company's commercial banking
functions including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and
investor real estate lending. This segment also includes equipment lease
financing, as well as capital markets activities, which include securities
underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, foreign exchange,
derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Corporate
Bank customers include corporate, middle market, and commercial real estate
developers and investors. Corresponding deposit products related to these
types of customers are also included in this segment.

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

The Consumer Bank segment represents the Company's branch network, including
consumer banking products and services related to residential first mortgages,
home equity lines and loans, branch small business loans, indirect loans,
consumer credit cards and other consumer loans, as well as the corresponding
deposit relationships. These services are also provided through alternative
channels such as the internet and telephone banking.

The Wealth Management segment offers individuals, businesses, governmental
institutions and non-profit entities a wide range of solutions to help
protect, grow and transfer wealth. Offerings include credit related products,
trust and investment management, asset management, retirement and savings
solutions and estate planning.

Discontinued operations includes all brokerage and investment activities
associated with the sale of Morgan Keegan which closed on April 2, 2012, as
well as the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates,
which closed on July 2, 2018. See Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" for related
discussion.

Other includes the Company's Treasury function, the securities portfolio,
wholesale funding activities, interest rate risk management activities and
other corporate functions that are not related to a strategic business unit.
Also within Other are certain reconciling items in order to translate the
segment results that are based on management accounting practices into
consolidated results. Management accounting practices utilized by Regions as
the basis of presentation for segment results include the following:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Net interest income and other financing income is presented based upon an FTP
approach, for which market-based funding charges/credits are assigned within
the segments. By allocating a cost or a credit to each product based on the
FTP framework, management is able to more effectively measure the net interest
margin contribution of its assets/liabilities by segment. The summation of the
interest income/expense and FTP charges/credits for each segment is its
designated net interest income and other financing income. The variance
between the Company's cumulative FTP charges and cumulative FTP credits is
offset in Other.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Provision for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on an estimated
loss methodology. The difference between the consolidated provision for loan
losses and the segments' estimated loss is reflected in Other.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Income tax expense (benefit) is calculated for the Corporate Bank, Consumer
Bank and Wealth Management based on a consistent federal and state statutory
rate. Discontinued Operations reflects the actual income tax expense (benefit)
of its results. Any difference between the Company's consolidated income tax
expense (benefit) and the segments' calculated amounts is reflected in Other.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Management reporting allocations of certain expenses are made in order to
analyze the financial performance of the segments. These allocations consist
of operational and overhead cost pools and are intended to represent the total
costs to support a segment.  
  
  

The following tables present financial information for each reportable segment
for the year ended December 31:

NOTE 24. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Credit risk associated with these instruments as of December 31 is represented
by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

Unused commitments to extend credit--To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to
consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among
others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan
commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to
expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements.

Standby letters of credit--Standby letters of credit are also issued to
customers which, commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if
certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the
customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby
letter of credit. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of
credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters
of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions
could be required to make and represents Regions' maximum credit risk.

Commercial letters of credit--Commercial letters of credit are issued to
facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general
rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in
transit.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Regions and its subsidiaries lease land, premises and equipment under
cancelable and non-cancelable leases, some of which contain renewal options
under various terms. The leased properties are used primarily for banking
purposes. Total rental expense on operating leases for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $166 million, $162 million and $167
million, respectively.

The approximate future minimum rental commitments as of December 31, 2018, for
all non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more
are shown in the following table. Included in these amounts are all renewal
options reasonably assured of being exercised.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice
of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss
contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably
estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as
circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss
contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining
the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies
however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance
coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds
are recorded in the period the recovery is received.

In addition, Regions has agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal
matters resulting from pre-closing activities in conjunction with the sale of
Morgan Keegan and recorded an indemnification obligation at fair value in the
second quarter of 2012.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
December 31, 2018, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably
possible estimate includes legal contingencies that are subject to the
indemnification agreement with Raymond James.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or

  

162

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

  

  

is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. Additional inquiries will
arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives
document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The
inquiries, including the one described below, could develop into
administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that
could result in consequences that have a material effect on Regions'
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a
whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments, findings,
settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses
and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the United States Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York pertaining to Regions' banking
relationship with a former customer and accounts maintained by related
entities and individuals affiliated with the customer who may be involved in
criminal activity, as well as related aspects of Regions' Anti-Money
Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

GUARANTEES

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

As discussed in Note 2, on April 2, 2012 ("Closing Date"), Regions closed the
sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection
with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters
related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the
Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses
under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for
judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution
of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments
that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is
indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. As of
December 31, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the indemnification
obligation were immaterial.

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal
balance for the majority of its DUS servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2018
and 2017, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $3.6
billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable
contingent liability related to its loss share guarantee was approximately
$1.2 billion and $923 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.The
Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services
for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to
default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be
without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $4 million at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Refer
to Note 1 for additional information.

VISA INDEMNIFICATION

As a member of the Visa USA network, Regions, along with other members,
indemnified Visa USA against litigation. On October 3, 2007, Visa USA was
restructured and acquired several Visa affiliates. In conjunction with this
restructuring, Regions' indemnification of Visa USA was modified to cover
specific litigation ("covered litigation").

A portion of Visa's proceeds from its IPO was put into escrow to fund the
covered litigation. To the extent that the amount available under the escrow
arrangement, or subsequent fundings of the escrow account resulting from
reductions in the class B share conversion ratio, is insufficient to fully
resolve the covered litigation, Visa will enforce the indemnification
obligations of Visa USA's members for any excess amount. At this time, Regions
has concluded that it is not probable that covered litigation exposure will
exceed the class B share value.

NOTE 25. REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services
is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or
services. Refer to Note 1 for descriptions of the accounting and reporting
policies related to revenue recognition.

The following tables present total non-interest income disaggregated by major
product category for each reportable segment for the period indicated.

This revenue is not impacted by the new accounting guidance and continues to
be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company's existing revenue
recognition policy.

---|---  
  
(2)

|

The amounts included for 2017 and 2016 have not been adjusted under the
modified retrospective method.  
  
Regions elected the practical expedient related to contract costs and will
continue to expense sales commissions and any related contract costs when
incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.

Regions also elected the practical expedient related to remaining performance
obligations and therefore did not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations for 1) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less and 2) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the
amount to which Regions has the right to invoice for services performed.
