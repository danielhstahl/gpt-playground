Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions
Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to
analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The terms "Regions," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" as used herein mean
collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words "future,"
"anticipates," "assumes," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "predicts,"
"potential," "objectives," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "projects,"
"outlook," "forecast," "would," "will," "may," "might," "could," "should,"
"can," and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking
statements. Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our businesses and financial results and conditions may constitute
forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects
may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-
looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain,
unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and
duration of the pandemic (including any second wave or resurgences), actions
taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct
and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather
are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and
information available to, management at the time the statements are made.
Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various
risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to
inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such
statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but
are not limited to, the risk identified in Part II Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of
this Form 10-Q and those described below:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States
generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern
United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values,
increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential
reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and
other businesses and our financial results and conditions.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other
activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar
organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely
affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

---|---  
  
•

|

The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our
businesses and financial results and conditions.The duration and severity of
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the global economy, has and
could continue to adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair
the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance
for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or
additional expenses. The pandemic could also cause an outflow of deposits,
result in goodwill impairment charges and the impairment of other financial
and nonfinancial assets, and increase our cost of capital.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets,
or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to
changes in law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining
operations of the reporting unit or other factors.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

The effect of changes in tax laws, including the effect of any future
interpretations of or amendments to Tax Reform, which may impact our earnings,
capital ratios and our ability to return capital to shareholders.

---|---  
  
•

|

Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible
impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating
leases.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes,
charge-offs, loan loss provisions or actual loan losses where our allowance
for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low
interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those
securities.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue
other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the
related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits,
which could adversely affect our net income.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional
financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources
than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards than we are.

|  
---|---

|

Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases, or
redemptions of preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, must

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions" or the "Company") provides a full
range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the
South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial
institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other
adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory
authorities.

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying
those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements
conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all
information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a
complete presentation of financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items,
necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
have been included. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in
Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and
disclosure through the filing date of this Form 10-Q.

During 2020, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to several
topics, including CECL. See Note 13 and below for related disclosures.

CECL

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL, which replaces the incurred loss
methodology with an expected loss methodology. The measurement of expected
losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized
cost, including loan receivables and debt securities held to maturity. It also
applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance
(loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other
similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in
accordance with accounting guidance on leases. In addition, CECL required
changes to the accounting for debt securities available for sale. The adoption
of CECL had a material impact to the allowance for credit losses (see below).
The cumulative effect of the modified retrospective application for all items
in scope was a reduction to retained earnings of $377 million, net of taxes,
$375 million of which was attributable to the allowance and $2 million of
which was attributable to other financial assets.

DEBT SECURITIES

The company adopted CECL using the prospective transition approach for debt
securities for which OTTI had previously been recognized. As a result, the
amortized cost basis remained the same before and after adoption. Recoveries
of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after
January 1, 2020 will be recorded in earnings when received.

For debt securities available for sale, CECL eliminates the concept of OTTI
and instead requires entities to determine if impairment is related to credit
loss or non-credit loss. In making the assessment of whether a loss is from
credit or other factors, management considers the extent to which fair value
is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a
rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among other
factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present
value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to
the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows
is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance
is created, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the
amortized cost basis.

Subsequent activity related to the credit loss component (e.g. write-offs,
recoveries) is recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses on debt
securities available for sale. Securities held to maturity are evaluated under
the allowance for credit losses model. For securities which have an
expectation of zero nonpayment of the amortized cost basis (e.g. U.S. Treasury
securities or agency securities), the expected credit loss is zero.

LOANS

Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost (the principal amount
outstanding, net of premiums, discounts, unearned income and deferred loan
fees and costs). Regions elected to exclude accrued interest receivable
balances from the amortized cost basis. Interest receivable is included as a
separate line item on the balance sheets. Additionally, Regions elected to not
estimate an allowance on interest receivable balances because the Company has
non-accrual policies in place that provide for the accrual of interest to
cease on a timely basis when all contractual amounts due are not expected. See
more information about Regions' non-accrual policies in Note 1 of Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Table of Contents

  

  

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Purchased loans are evaluated and classified as either PCD, which indicates
that the loan has experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration
since origination, or non-PCD loans. For PCD loans, the sum of the loans'
purchase price and allowance for credit losses, which is determined using the
same methodology as originated loans, becomes their initial amortized cost
basis. For non-PCD loans, the difference between the fair value and the par
value is considered the fair value mark. The non-credit discount or premium
related to PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans is accreted or
amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the
effective interest method. Subsequent changes in the allowance related to PCD
and non-PCD loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses.

TDRs are loans whereby the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at
the time of restructuring, and Regions has granted a concession to the
borrower. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery
on the loan and may take the form of modifications to the stated interest rate
such that it is lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar
risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of
normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in limited circumstances
forgiveness of principal and/or interest. Insignificant delays in payments are
not considered TDRs. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, all
loans with the TDR designation were considered to be impaired, even if they
were accruing. With the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the definition of
impaired loans was removed from accounting guidance.

ALLOWANCE

Regions adopted CECL using the modified retrospective method for loans held
for investment, net investment in lease assets, and off-balance sheet credit
exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020 are
presented under CECL while prior periods' amounts continue to be reported in
accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The cumulative effect of the
retrospective application for loans and unfunded commitments was an increase
in the allowance of $501 million and a reduction to retained earnings of $375
million, with the difference being an increase to deferred tax assets.

Upon the adoption of CECL, the allowance is intended to cover expected credit
losses over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost,
including unfunded commitments. Management's measurement of expected credit
losses is based on relevant information about past events, including
historical experience, current conditions, and R&S forecasts that affect the
collectability of the reported amount. For periods beyond which Regions makes
or obtains such R&S forecasts, Regions reverts to historical credit loss
information. Regions maintains an appropriate level of allowance that falls
within an acceptable range of estimated losses, measured in accordance with
GAAP. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is
based on many factors, including, but not limited to, an evaluation and rating
of the loan portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current economic
conditions; collateral values securing loans; levels of problem loans; volume,
growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio; regulatory guidance;
R&S economic forecasts; and other relevant factors. Changes in any of these
factors, assumptions, or the availability of new information, could require
that the allowance be adjusted in future periods, perhaps materially. Loss
forecasting models are built on historical loss information and then applied
to the current portfolio. Outputs from the loss forecasting models in
combination with Regions' qualitative framework, and other analyses are used
to inform management in its estimation of Regions' expected credit losses.
Actual losses could vary, perhaps materially, from management's estimates. The
entire allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the
loan portfolio.

Regions' allowance calculation is a significant estimate. Regions uses its
best judgment to assess economic conditions and loss data in estimating the
CECL allowance and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on
changes in underlying external or internal data. Therefore, assumptions and
decisions driving the estimate may change as conditions change. These
assumptions and estimates are detailed below.

R & S forecast period

During the two-year R&S forecast period, Regions incorporates forward-looking
information by utilizing its internally developed and approved Base economic
forecast. The scenario is developed by the Chief Economist and approved
through a formal governance process. The Base forecast considers market
forward/consensus information and is consistent with the Company's
organization-wide economic outlook. When appropriate, additional scenarios,
including externally created scenarios, are considered as part of the
determination of the allowance.

Reversion period

Regions utilizes an exponential reversion approach that reverts to TTC rates
derived from the simple average of all historical quarterly observations for
PD, LGD, EAD and prepayment rates. The length of the reversion period differs
by class of financing receivable.

Historical loss period

Regions does not adjust historical loss information for existing economic
conditions or expectations of future economic conditions for periods that are
beyond the R&S period. Regions utilizes internal historical loss information;
however, there are certain loan portfolios that also benefit from the use of
external or other reference data due to identified limitations with internal
historical data.

Contractual life

Regions estimates expected credit losses over the contractual life of a loan.
Regions defines contractual life for non-revolving loans as contractual
maturity, net of estimated prepayments and excluding expected extensions,
renewals and modifications unless 1) Regions has a reasonable expectation at
the reporting date that it will execute a TDR with the borrower ("RETDR") or
2) extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified
contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by
Regions.

RETDR

Regions individually identifies commercial and investor real estate loans for
inclusion as RETDRs. The identification criteria are based on internal risk
ratings and time to maturity. Regions typically does not identify consumer
loans as RETDRs due to the insignificant period between initial contact with a
customer regarding a loan modification and when a TDR modification is
consummated.

The RETDR status extends the life of the loan past the contractual maturity
and includes the allowance impact of interest rate concessions. Loans
identified as RETDRs will be treated consistently from a modeling/reserving
perspective as loans identified as TDRs.

Contractual term extensions (borrower versus lender option to renew)

Regions' consumer loan contracts do not permit automatic extensions or
unilateral customer extensions, and Regions retains the right to approve or
deny any extension requested from the borrower. As a result, extensions and
renewal options are not included in the life of consumer loans for the
purposes of calculating the allowance. Similarly, Regions does not include
extension and renewal options in the life of commercial loans for the purposes
of calculating the allowance, unless it is a RETDR. Most commercial products
do not offer borrowers a unilateral right to renew or extend.

Contractual life of credit card receivables

Regions estimates the life of credit card receivables based on the amount and
timing of payments expected to be collected. Regions' credit card allowance
estimate only considers the amount of debt outstanding at the reporting date
(the current position) because undrawn balances are unconditionally
cancellable and therefore are not considered. Regions classifies credit card
accounts into one of three payment patterns: dormant, transacting or
revolving. The dormant accounts are idle, carry no balance, and do not
contribute to the allowance. The transacting account holders tend to pay the
entire balance due every month and are, therefore, subject to practically no
interest charges. For transactor accounts, the current position balance is
expected to be paid off in one quarter. The revolving accounts tend to be
subject to interest charges, and their current position balance liquidates
over time. Regions' credit card portfolio is comprised primarily of revolvers.

Collateral-dependent loans

Regions' collateral-dependent consumer loans are loans secured by collateral
(primarily real estate) that meet the partial charge-down requirements
disclosed in Note 1 of Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Regions evaluates significant commercial and investor loans
that are in financial difficulty and secured by collateral to determine if
they are collateral dependent.

For collateral-dependent loans, CECL requires an entity to measure the
expected credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral at the
reporting date when the entity determines that foreclosure is probable.
Additionally, CECL allows a fair value of collateral practical expedient as a
measurement approach for loans when the repayment is expected to be provided
substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty ("collateral dependent"). For
any collateral-dependent loans that meet Regions' specific allowance criteria
(see below), Regions will calculate the CECL allowance based on the fair value
of collateral methodology. For collateral-dependent consumer, commercial and
investor real estate loans that do not meet Regions' specific allowance
criteria (as described below), Regions considers the value of the collateral
through the LGD component of the loss model based on collateral type.

Credit enhancements

Regions' estimate of credit losses reflects how credit enhancements, other
than those that are freestanding contracts, mitigate expected credit losses on
financial assets. In the event that a credit enhancement arrangement is
considered to be a freestanding contract, Regions excludes the credit
enhancement from the related loan when estimating expected credit losses.

Unfunded commitments and other off-balance sheet items

CECL requires an entity to record a liability or allowance for credit losses
for the unfunded portion of a loan commitment in the event that the issuer
does not have the unconditional right to cancel the commitment. For an
unfunded commitment to be considered unconditionally cancellable, Regions must
be able to, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit. The
liability is measured over the full contractual period for which Regions is
exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to

  

16

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

extend credit. In determining the liability, management considers the
likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the related expected credit
losses under the CECL model.

Regions' off-balance sheet unfunded commitments in the form of home equity
lines, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit and commercial
revolving products that are deemed to be conditionally cancellable will
include unfunded balances within the allowance estimate. Future advances from
certain unfunded commitments and other revolving products where Regions does
have the unconditional right to cancel these agreements will not be included.

CALCULATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Pooled allowances

The allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk
characteristics exist. Segmentation variables for commercial and investor real
estate segments include product, loan size, collateral type, risk rating and
term. Segmentation variables considered for consumer segments include product,
FICO, LTV, age, TDR status, etc. The allowance is estimated for most
portfolios and classes using econometric models to estimate expected credit
losses. In general, discounted cash flow models are not used for the purpose
of estimating expected losses for the purpose of the ACL. Most of the
econometric models include PD, LGD, and EAD components. Less complex
estimation methods are used for smaller loan portfolios.

Specific allowances

Due to their size, complexity and individualized risk characteristics and
monitoring, the allowance for significant non-accrual commercial and investor
real estate loans (including TDRs) and unfunded commitments is measured on an
individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the
collective evaluation. Regions generally measures the allowance for these
loans based on the present value of estimated cash flows, considering all
facts and circumstances specific to the borrower and market and economic
conditions. The allowance measurement for collateral-dependent loans that meet
the individually evaluated threshold is based on the fair value of collateral
methodology.

TDRs and RETDRs

Loans identified as TDRs and RETDRs are included in their respective loan
pools (if they do not qualify for specific evaluation) and losses are
determined by CECL models. The effect of the interest rate concession on these
loans is considered through a post-model adjustment.

Qualitative framework

While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors,
any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of
imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent
time lag between obtaining information, performing the calculation, as well as
variations between estimates and actual outcomes. Regions adjusts the
allowance considering quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be
directly measured in the modeled calculations. Regions' qualitative framework
provides for specific, quantitatively supported model adjustments and general
imprecision adjustments. Specific model adjustments capture highly specific
issues or events that Regions believes are not adequately captured in model
outcomes. General imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision
that are not specifically identifiable or quantifiable to a particular loan
portfolio and have not been captured by the model or by a specific model
adjustment. Regions considers general imprecision in three dimensions;
economic forecast imprecision, model error imprecision, and process
imprecision.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

During the third quarter of 2020, an equity investee held by the Company
executed an initial public offering. As a result, the investment was
categorized as an equity investment measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using the framework provided in "Note 1 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

Equity investments, which consists of the Company's holding in an equity
investee that is traded on an active exchange, is valued using a quoted market
price for a similar instrument in an active market, adjusted for marketability
considerations; this valuation is a Level 2 measurement.

Debt securities with carrying values of $10.1 billion and $8.3 billion at
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, were pledged to
secure public funds, trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements.
Included within total pledged securities is approximately $24 million of
encumbered U.S. Treasury securities at both September 30, 2020, and December
31, 2019.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities held to
maturity and debt securities available for sale at September 30, 2020, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the
tables above decreased from 500 at December 31, 2019, to 131 at September 30,
2020. The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of
unrealized losses from year-end 2019 was primarily due to changes in market
interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no
indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the
tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no
individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented
credit impairment as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and
it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the
positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at
maturity.

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities
available for sale are shown in the table below. The cost of securities sold
is based on the specific identification method. As part of the Company's
normal process for evaluating impairment, management did identify a limited
number of positions where impairment was believed to exist in certain periods,
as shown in the table below.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, Regions purchased
approximately $1.3 billion and $877 million in indirect-other consumer,
residential first mortgage and commercial and industrial loans from third
parties, respectively. Approximately $36 million of the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 purchases will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2020.

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending
business due to margin compression impacting overall returns on the portfolio.
Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of
2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings at the end of
the second quarter of 2019. The Company remains in the direct auto lending
business.

At September 30, 2020, $21.4 billion in securities and net eligible loans held
by Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the
FHLB. At September 30, 2020, an additional $19.3 billion in net eligible loans
held by Regions were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings.

Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance are sales-type and
direct financing leases totaling $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2020, with
related income of $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaces the incurred loss
methodology with an expected loss methodology. Refer to Note 1 "Basis of
Presentation" and Note 13 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for description
of the adoption of CECL and Regions' allowance methodology. Additionally,
refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2019, for a description of the methodology prior to
the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

As of September 30, 2020, Regions' total loans included $4.6 billion of PPP
loans. These loans are guaranteed by the Federal government and as the
guarantee is not separable from the loans, Regions did not record an allowance
on these loans.

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The cumulative effect of the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 for loans and
unfunded commitments was an increase in the allowance of $501 million. During
the first nine months of 2020, Regions increased the allowance by an
additional $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion, which represents management's best
estimate of expected losses over the life of the portfolio. The increase was
due primarily to higher expected credit losses due to the economic impact and
ongoing uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Macroeconomic factors utilized
in the CECL loss models include, but are not limited to, unemployment rate,
GDP, HPI and the S&P 500 index, with unemployment being the most significant
macroeconomic factor within the CECL models. Regions' models

  

21

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

are sensitive to changes in the economic scenario. The September 30, 2020
economic forecast includes uncertainty around the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
including availability of a vaccine, ultimate consumer impact/the
effectiveness of government relief programs and debt payment relief provided
by Regions, further stimulus packages and the path for fully opening the
economy. These factors cannot be fully reflected in the model. Therefore, the
risks to the economic forecast and the model limitations were considered
through model adjustments and the qualitative framework.

The following tables present analyses of the allowance by portfolio segment
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The total
allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances for
the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are disaggregated to detail the
amounts derived through individual evaluation and collective evaluation for
impairment. Prior to 2020, the allowance for loan losses related to
individually evaluated loans was attributable to allowances for non-accrual
commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs ("impaired loans") and
the allowance for loan losses related to collectively evaluated loans was
attributable to the remainder of the portfolio. With the adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2020, the impaired loan designation and disclosures related to
impaired loans are no longer required.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS

The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the
portfolio segments.

Commercial--The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and
industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations
to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion
projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate
mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term
financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by
business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial
businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the
repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the
borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness
of underlying

borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers' business operations, and the
sensitivity to market fluctuations in commodity prices.

Investor Real Estate--Loans for real estate development are repaid through
cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This
portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or
investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income
generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real
estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product
types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions' markets.
Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such
as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping
centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the
valuation of real estate.

Consumer--The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage,
home equity lines, home equity loans, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other
consumer, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans. Residential first
mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These
loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are
extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Home equity lending
includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending,
which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence,
allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate
market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the
amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact the
depth of potential losses. Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending
initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans
made through automotive dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending includes
other point of sale lending through third parties. Consumer credit card
lending includes Regions branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer
loans include other revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and
overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and
other key consumer economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

The following tables present credit quality indicators for portfolio segments
and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of September 30, 2020.

Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are detailed by
categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default.
Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the
relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis
or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the
borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories
are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Pass--includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Special Mention--includes obligations that have potential weakness that may,
if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the
Company's position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also
be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an
adverse effect on debt service ability;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Substandard Accrual--includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness
that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently
performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility
that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not
corrected;  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Non-accrual--includes obligations where management has determined that full
payment of principal and interest is in doubt.  
  
Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to
as "classified." Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans
are often collectively referred to as "criticized and classified."

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment rates, home prices, accrual status and geography as credit
quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio. FICO scores are obtained
at origination as part of Regions' formal underwriting process. Refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans, including
residential first mortgage loans. Current FICO data is not available for
certain loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers
do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. These
categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.
The higher the FICO score the less probability of default and vice versa.

With the adoption of CECL in 2020, the disclosure of credit quality indicators
for loan portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, is
presented by credit quality indicator by vintage year. Regions defines the
vintage date for the purposes of disclosure as the date of the most recent
credit decision. In general, renewals are categorized as new credit decisions
and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Loans that are modified as a
TDR are considered to be a continuation of the original loan, therefore the
origination date of the original loan is reflected as the vintage date. The
following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan
portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of September
30, 2020. Classes in the commercial and investor real estate portfolio
segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes in the consumer portfolio
segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for
Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2019, for the Credit Quality Indicator tables.

AGING AND NON-ACCRUAL ANALYSIS

The following tables include an aging analysis of DPD and loans on non-accrual
status for each portfolio segment and class as of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019. Loans on non-accrual status with no related allowance
included $67 million of commercial and industrial loans as of September 30,
2020. Non-accrual loans with no related allowance typically include loans
where the underlying collateral is deemed sufficient to recover all remaining
principal. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, all TDRs and all
non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans, excluding leases, were
deemed to be impaired. The definition of impairment and the required impaired
loan disclosures were removed with CECL. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit
Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019
for disclosure of Regions' impaired loans as of December 31, 2019. Loans that
have been fully charged-off do not appear in the tables below.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order
to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly, Regions works to meet the
individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP.
Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional information regarding
the Company's TDRs.

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan
modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through
the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 are
eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of
the CARES Act; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for
relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.
The CARES Act relief and short-term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals
precluded the majority of Regions' COVID-19 loan modifications from being
classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2020.

Further discussion related to TDRs, including their impact on the allowance
upon adoption of CECL is included in Note 1 "Basis of Presentation."
Additional discussion related to TDRs, including their impact on the allowance
and designation of TDRs in periods subsequent to the modification prior to the
adoption of CECL is included in Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and discussion
in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a
TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the
financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made
to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs. Loans first reported as
TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 totaled
approximately $458 million and $185 million, respectively.

NOTE 4. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions
including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates,
servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of
mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in
the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying
amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers
recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value
measurement method:

________

(1) "Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both
total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. In the first quarter of 2020,
Regions revised its MSR decay methodology from a passage of time approach to a
discounted net cash flow approach. The change in methodology results in shifts
between decay and hedge impacts, but does not impact the overall valuation.

On March 27, 2019, the Company sold $167 million of affordable housing
residential mortgage loans and as part of the transaction kept the rights to
service the loans, which resulted in the retained residential MSR of
approximately $2 million.

On September 30, 2019, the Company purchased the rights to service
approximately $409 million in residential mortgage loans for approximately $4
million.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company
purchased rights to service residential mortgage loans on a flow basis for
approximately $35 million and $7 million, respectively.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based
on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption
on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any
other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes
in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the
estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes
contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income
resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans:

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard
representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the
quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for
sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be
required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the
purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are
breached.

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential
mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This
repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets and reflects management's estimate of losses based on
historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may
result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends.
Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the
consolidated statements of income.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the
multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions
services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible
assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee
associated with the loans. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Also see Note 12 for additional information related to the guarantee.

As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the DUS servicing portfolio
was approximately $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The related
commercial MSRs were approximately $72 million at September 30, 2020 and $59
million at December 31, 2019. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs
was approximately $79 million at September 30, 2020 and $64 million December
31, 2019.

The goodwill allocated to the Corporate Bank reporting unit increased due to
the acquisition of Ascentium in the second quarter of 2020.

Regions evaluates each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment on an annual
basis in the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying value. A detailed description of the Company's methodology
and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each
reporting unit is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adverse changes in
the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors could result
in a decline in the implied fair value of goodwill.

During the third quarter 2020, Regions assessed events and circumstances for
all three reporting units as of September 30, 2020, and through the date of
the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that could potentially
indicate goodwill impairment including analyzing the impacts from the COVID-19
pandemic. The indicators assessed included:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Recent operating performance,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in market capitalization,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Regulatory actions and assessments,  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors,
competition, and the impacts of COVID-19),  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset
impairments, and business dispositions), and  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Trends in the banking industry.  
  
After assessing the indicators noted above, Regions determined that it was not
more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
carrying value as of September 30, 2020. Therefore, Regions determined that a
test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions' reporting
units for the September 30, 2020 interim period. Regions will continue to
monitor for indicators of impairment throughout 2020.

each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029, three-month LIBOR plus
3.148%.

(4) Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to
(i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2025, 5.750%, and (ii)
for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2025, the five-year
treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date plus
5.426%.

All series of preferred stock have no stated maturity and redemption is solely
at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part,
after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, within 90
days following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series A preferred
stock or at any time following a regulatory capital treatment event for the
Series B, Series C, and Series D preferred stock.

The Board of Directors declared $24 million in cash dividends on both Series A
and Series B Preferred Stock during both the first nine months of 2020 and
2019. In the first nine months of 2020, the Board of Directors declared $21
million in cash dividends on Series C Preferred Stock. In the third quarter of
2019, the Board of Directors declared the initial $8 million in cash dividends
on the Series C Preferred Stock. The initial quarterly dividend for the Series
D Preferred Stock was declared in the third quarter of 2020 for $6 million.
Therefore, a total of $75 million in cash dividends on total preferred stock
was declared in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the total of $56
million in cash dividends on total preferred stock declared in the first nine
months of 2019.

In the event Series A, Series B, Series C, or Series D preferred shares are
redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $113 million, $67 million, $10 million,
or $4 million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will
be recognized, respectively. Approximately $100 million of Series A preferred
dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including
related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and
approximately $13 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Approximately $52
million of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of
preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to
retained earnings, and approximately $15 million of related issuance costs
that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related
surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common
shareholders. Approximately $10 million of Series C issuance costs that were
recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be
recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders.
Approximately $4 million of Series D issuance costs that were recorded as a
reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a
reduction to net income available to common shareholders.

COMMON STOCK

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020 and Regions is in compliance with the capital plan. Prior to the
supervisory stress test submission, the Board had authorized the repurchase of
$1.370 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting repurchases from the
beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve mandated that banks must
not increase their quarterly per share common dividend and implemented an
earnings-based payout restriction in connection with the supervisory stress
test, requiring the third quarter 2020 dividend to not exceed the average of
the prior four quarters of net income excluding preferred dividends. This
mandate was subsequently extended through the end of 2020.

In consideration of the specific Federal Reserve limitations on capital
distributions, which prevented banks from increasing their third quarter 2020
per share common dividend, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.155 per
common share for the third quarter 2020 which was consistent with the $0.155
per common share declared for both the first and second quarters of 2020,
totaling $0.465 per common share for the first nine months of 2020. The Board
declared a cash dividend for third quarter of 2019 of $0.155 per common share
and $0.140 per common share both the first and second quarter of 2019,
totaling $0.435 per common share for the first nine months of 2019.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (credit) is recorded
in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income.
Components other than service cost are recorded in other non-interest expense
on the consolidated statements of income.

Regions' funding policy for the qualified plans is to contribute annually at
least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made no
contributions during the first nine months of 2020.

Regions also provides other postretirement benefits, such as defined benefit
health care plans and life insurance plans, that cover certain retired
employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on
the consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2020 or 2019.

Estimated fair value includes premium of approximately $86 million as of
September 30, 2020 and $108 million as of December, 31, 2019 to be amortized
over the remaining life. Approximately $15 million of the decrease since
December 31, 2019 related to hedges that were terminated during the third
quarter of 2020 and was not amortized into earnings as of the date of
termination.

(5)

|

Netting adjustments represent amounts recorded to convert derivative assets
and derivative liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance
with applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the
impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master
netting agreements and variation margin that allow Regions to settle
derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the
net position with the related cash collateral.

---|---  
  
(6)

|

The gain amounts,which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or
reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other
derivative positions. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
financial instruments posted of $24 million, for both periods, were not offset
in the consolidated balance sheets.  
  
HEDGING DERIVATIVES

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate
asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are
classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for
additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value
of an asset, liability or firm commitment.

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate
exposure on the Company's fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the
receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments
over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-
rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future
cash flows or other forecasted transactions.

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall
cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans.
The agreements effectively modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk
by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate
floors. As of September 30, 2020, Regions is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions through 2026 and
a portion of these hedges are forward starting.

The following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges
on AOCI. The balance of terminated cash flow hedges in AOCI will be amortized
into earnings through 2026.

premium amortization on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months.
Included in this amount is $22 million in pre-tax net gains related to the
amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges.

As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had terminated
fair value hedges related to debt securities available for sale with carrying
values of $303 million and $337 million, respectively. The remaining basis
adjustments related to these terminated hedges were $1 million and $3 million,
respectively.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and
futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its
commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a
derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this
customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to
reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with
its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in
this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the
counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated
as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital
markets fee income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as
appropriate.

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to
originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined
prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Regions had $1.2 billion and $366
million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock
commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and
mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans
held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair
value based on management's election. At September 30, 2020 and December 31,
2019, Regions had $1.9 billion and $622 million, respectively, in total
notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-
to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward
sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in
mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock
commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial
mortgage loans are included in capital markets income.

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any
changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the
election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various
derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures
contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair
value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the total notional amount related to
these contracts was $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of
participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap
participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of
customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the
customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early
termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2021 and 2029.
Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have
maturities between 2020 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit
protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if
the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon
early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of
the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on
recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management
practices of unfunded commitments.

Regions' maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as
of September 30, 2020 was approximately $510 million. This scenario occurs if
variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted
with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at September 30, 2020
and 2019 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit
protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap
transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions' obligation.

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices.
These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread
risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option
has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit
protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if
losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the
tranche rating of the capital structure.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of Regions' derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers
contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions
regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to
terminate the contracts in the event that Regions' and/or Regions Bank's
credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating
agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, were $61 million and $64 million,
respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $61 million and $67
million, respectively, in the normal course of business.

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
Refer to Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" for an updated description of the
equity investments valuation methodology. Assets and liabilities measured at
fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements.
Marketable equity securities and debt securities available for sale may be
periodically transferred to or from Level 3 valuation based on management's
conclusion regarding the observability of inputs used in valuing the
securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if they occur at the beginning
of a reporting period.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis:

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material
price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets
represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions'

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

Residential mortgage servicing rights

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow
projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash
flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and
changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including
servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs
will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change
in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at
period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions
included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 4.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential
mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated with the
intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the
changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements
for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other
loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using
derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for
sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available
and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for
securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions,
and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value
and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale
measured at fair value:

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on
contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale
in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which
were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. These
changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An
immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-
specific credit risk.

Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value premium on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at September
30, 2020 was $636 million or 0.8 percent

Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The
assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those
that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In
estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for estimated changes in
interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads in the periods they are
deemed to have occurred.

The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a
third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the
loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. The
fair value discount on the loan portfolio's net carrying amount at December
31, 2019 was $42 million or 0.1 percent.

NOTE 11. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Each of Regions' reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves
specific needs of Regions' customers based on the products and services
provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the
financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable
segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the
remainder in Other. Additional information about the Company's reportable
segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a
dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements
are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be
periodically revised.

(1) Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses
is the sum of the provision for loans losses and the provision for unfunded
credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded
commitments was included in other non-interest expense. See Note 23 "Business
Segment Information" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019 for information on how the provision is allocated to each
reportable segment.

  

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with
lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is
subject to Regions' normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions
measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a
reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that
the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or
counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management's assessment of the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

Unused commitments to extend credit--To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to
consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among
others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan
commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to
expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements.

Standby letters of credit--Standby letters of credit are also issued to
customers, which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if
certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the
customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby
letter of credit. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees
is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as
such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. Historically, a large
percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The
contractual amount of standby letters of credit represents the maximum
potential amount of future payments Regions could be required to make and
represents Regions' maximum credit risk.

Commercial letters of credit--Commercial letters of credit are issued to
facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general
rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in
transit.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to
litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates
these contingencies based on

  

52

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

information currently available, including advice of counsel. Regions
establishes accruals for those matters when a loss contingency is considered
probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any accruals are
periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as circumstances change. Some of
Regions' exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by
applicable insurance coverage. In determining the amounts of any accruals or
estimates of possible loss contingencies however, Regions does not take into
account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that Regions has
an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the recovery is
received.

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether
or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate
such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur
losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate
estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is
reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions
has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $20 million as of
September 30, 2020, with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could
incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available
information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as
well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably
possible estimate includes a legal contingency that is subject to an
indemnification agreement.

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they
involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the
following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are
unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for
punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal
uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves
multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not
complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and
whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action
litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation,
are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding
when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential
class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to
estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters
disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not
include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests,
investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental
regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies
regarding Regions' business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the
conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. For example, Regions is in
the process of responding to a civil investigative demand from the CFPB
relating to certain of Regions' overdraft practices and policies. Additional
inquiries will arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries,
Regions receives document requests, subpoenas and other requests for
information. The inquiries could develop into administrative, civil or
criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that could result in consequences
that have a material effect on Regions' consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could
include adverse judgments, findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders,
injunctions, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and could
result in additional expenses and collateral costs, including reputational
damage.

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries
is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the
outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a
material effect on Regions' business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any
of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions' business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any
particular reporting period of occurrence.

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-
family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is
required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third for the majority
of its DUS servicing portfolio. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $4.4 billion and
$3.9 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability
related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3
billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company
would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for
Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default
and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without
value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable
contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company
would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss
share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets was approximately $5 million and $4 million at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 1 in the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for additional information.

ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

  

|

This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses to replace the
current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss
approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other
commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all
available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses,
including details about past events, current conditions, and R&S forecasts.
The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect the portion of the
amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to collect.

  

The ASU also eliminates the current accounting model for purchased credit-
impaired loans, but requires an allowance to be recognized for purchased-
credit-deteriorated (PCD) assets (those that have experienced more-than-
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination). Entities
that had loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should
prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit
deteriorated assets.

  

Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required upon
adoption.  
  
While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the
ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit
losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized
cost of the securities by direct write-offs.  
  
The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

|

January 1, 2020

|

The allowance increased by $501 million based on loan exposure balances and
Regions' internally developed macroeconomic forecast upon adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2020.

  

The increase in the allowance at adoption was primarily the result of
significant increases within the consumer portfolio segment, specifically
residential first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines, and
indirect-other consumer. The impact to the residential first mortgage and home
equity classes was mainly driven by their longer time to maturity.
Additionally, a significant portion of the indirect-other consumer class is
unsecured lending through third parties which yielded higher loss rates. Under
CECL these higher loss rates compounded over a life of loan estimate result in
a significantly larger allowance estimate.

  

A suite of controls including governance, data, forecast and model controls
was in place at adoption.

  

The impact was reflected as a reduction of approximately $375 million to
retained earnings and an increase of approximately $126 million to deferred
tax assets. In the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Banking agencies
finalized a rule related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, plus 25 percent of subsequent changes in allowance. At September 30,
2020 this amount is approximately $611 million year-to-date. The impact on
CET1 is approximately 56 basis points.

There was no material impact to available for sale or held to maturity
securities upon adoption of CECL, nor to any other financial assets in scope.
Most of the held to maturity portfolio consists of agency-backed securities
that inherently have an immaterial risk of loss. Additionally, Regions had no
PCI assets that were converted to PCD upon adoption.

  

See Note 1 Basis of Presentation for additional information about Regions'
CECL methodologies and assumptions.

Topic 718. The amount recorded as a reduction of the transaction price is
required to be measured on the basis of the grant-date fair value of the
share-based payment award measured in accordance with Topic 718. The grant
date is the date at which a grantor (supplier) and grantee (customer) reach a
mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment
award. The classification and subsequent measurement of the award are subject
to the guidance in Topic 718 unless the share-based payment award is

Item 2\. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial
Corporation's ("Regions" or the "Company") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC and updates Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019, which was previously filed with the SEC. This
financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions' financial
position and results of operations and should be read together with the
financial information contained in the Form 10-K. See Note 1 "Basis of
Presentation" and Note 13 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the
consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of this
discussion will be on the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 for the
consolidated statements of income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the
emphasis of this discussion will be the balances as of September 30, 2020
compared to December 31, 2019.

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See pages 7 through 9 for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

CORPORATE PROFILE

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional
commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial
services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities
brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other
specialty financing.

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama
state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At September 30, 2020, Regions operated 1,381 total branch outlets.
Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three
reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth
Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 11 "Business Segment
Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding Regions' segment reporting structure.

On May 31, 2019, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Highland
Associates, Inc., an institutional investment firm based in Birmingham,
Alabama. The transaction closed on August 1, 2019.

On February 27, 2020, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Ascentium
Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company headquartered in
Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and included
approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses. Refer to
the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail.

Regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is
dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well
as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the
difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions'
net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet
components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets
and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and
secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital
markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of
operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-
interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and
other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting
regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal
policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all,
financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and
fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and
investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market
activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing
products in Regions' market areas.

Regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to
develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution
network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile
banking.

THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions' loan
portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary
markets in which it operates. While on a quarterly average basis economic
growth was notably robust in the third quarter, the pace of growth decelerated
through the quarter, and growth is expected to settle into a slower but more
sustainable pace over coming quarters. For full-year 2020, real GDP is
expected to contract by 3.8 percent and to grow by 3.6 percent in 2021. As the
COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, there remains a heightened degree of
uncertainty around economic forecasts.

Table of Contents

  

  

After the loss of more than 22 million non-farm jobs over March and April, the
economy added over 11.4 million jobs over the subsequent five months, though
this still left the level of non-farm employment as of September more than
10.6 million jobs below the level as of February. The unemployment rate has
continued to recede from the peak of 14.7 percent in April, falling to 7.9
percent in September, although part of that decline reflects lower labor force
participation. The incidence of permanent job losses has increased over recent
months as the duration of unemployment has increased. While the labor market
continues to heal, progress will likely be harder to come by in the months
ahead.

While the significant amount of financial support to households provided under
the CARES Act helped sustain consumer spending during second and third
quarters of 2020, and as the labor market began to recover, growth in labor
earnings, the largest component of personal income, also began to rebound
sharply. Still, there is a sharp divergence in patterns of consumer spending
on goods and consumer spending on services. By June, the level of consumer
spending on goods had surpassed the level as of February, but as of August the
level of consumer spending on services remained well below the level as of
February. This reflects ongoing restrictions on activities such as tourism,
dining out, recreation, and attendance at sporting events, while shifting
consumer attitudes toward engaging in such activities could also be playing a
role. Either way, providers of such services continue to struggle to gain
traction.

The story in the industrial sector and the housing market is quite different.
The ISM Manufacturing Index points to a recovery in the manufacturing sector
that is becoming increasingly entrenched, and this is supported by growth in
business orders for capital goods. New single family construction and sales of
new and existing homes have surprised to the upside over recent months, in
part reflecting the benefits of notably low mortgage interest rates. While the
pace of growth in demand seen in the third quarter is unlikely to be
sustained, construction and sales of new homes are likely to rise further, but
persistently lean inventories will continue to dampen growth in sales of
existing homes.

While the economy is expected to settle into a path of steady but moderate
economic growth over coming quarters, a considerable degree of uncertainty
continues to cloud the outlook, which will remain the case until there is more
clarity around the public health picture. Though Congress agreeing to an
additional bill to provide assistance to households and small businesses is
the most likely outcome, it remains uncertain when an agreement will be
reached and what would be included in any such bill. Additionally, the outlook
for growth in 2021 and beyond could be impacted by the outcome of the November
elections. The October baseline forecast anticipates the level of real GDP
will return to the level as of the fourth quarter of 2019, the last quarter
free of the effects of COVID-19, in the first quarter of 2022.

The effects within the Regions footprint will be broadly similar to those seen
in the U.S. as a whole. Florida's economy has an above-average exposure to
leisure and hospitality services, while Texas and Louisiana have above-average
exposure to energy, so these economies could be more prone to lasting effects
if the recovery does prove to be slower than is now anticipated.

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions'
forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of September 30, 2020. See the
"Allowance" section for further information.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the
economic environment in which the Company operates. The adverse economic
conditions and uncertainty in the economic outlook as of September 30, 2020
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the third quarter 2020
financial results in the areas as described below. Regions expects that the
pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and the Company's
financial results in future quarters.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions re-opened branches for walk-in services.
As branch lobbies re-open, Regions continues to keep measures in place to help
ensure associate and customer safety, such as providing face coverings for all
associates and reducing occupancy levels to encourage social distancing. As of
September 30, 2020, approximately 99% of branches were open. Regions is in the
process of implementing a phased approach to return remote working associates
to office locations. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 90 percent of the
Company's non-branch associates are working remotely.

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company continued to offer special
financial assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial
hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering
customer payment deferrals or forbearances to existing loans over a set period
of time, typically 90 days. Residential mortgage payment assistance is granted
through a forbearance. During the forbearance period, a borrower's payment
obligation is suspended and no foreclosure action will be pursued. All
payments are then due at expiration of the forbearance period, unless the loan
has been modified. For most other loan products (commercial and consumer
products except for residential real estate), payment assistance is granted
through deferrals or extensions. Deferrals and extensions are different than
forbearances in that all payments are normally not due at the end of the
deferral or extension period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced.
However, for most all products, interest continues to accrue on the loan
during the deferral or forbearance period, unless the loan is on non-accrual.

Table of Contents

  

  

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had total outstanding customer payment
deferrals of approximately $1.5 billion, a decline of $4.2 billion from the
second quarter. As of September 30, 2020, Regions had approximately 2,600
outstanding deferrals for business customers totaling approximately $468
million, of which approximately 68% are in a second deferral. Total business
deferrals have declined $3.3 billion compared to June 30, 2020. As of
September 30, 2020, Regions had approximately 8,900 consumer payment deferrals
outstanding totaling $1.0 billion, of which approximately 85% are in a second
deferral. Total consumer deferrals have declined $900 million from the second
quarter. Included in consumer deferrals are approximately 4,800 forbearances
related to residential mortgages totaling approximately $920 million, of which
approximately 37% relate to loans repurchased from GNMA during the third
quarter of 2020. Total mortgage deferrals declined $476 million from the
second quarter and approximately 88% were in second deferral as of September
30, 2020. The second forbearance period expired for most loans in October,
therefore these loans will either be modified, granted another forbearance (if
approved through Regions' credit risk management framework) or will be
evaluated for partial write-down and non-accrual status during the fourth
quarter 2020. In addition Regions had active forbearances for approximately
9,300 mortgage loans serviced for others outstanding totaling approximately
$1.5 billion, as of September 30, 2020.

During the months of August and September, approximately 20% of borrowers made
a mortgage payment while in forbearance, approximately 20% of borrowers made a
home equity payment, approximately 34% made a credit card payment, and
approximately 10% made an auto loan payment while in deferral. Additionally,
during the months of August and September, approximately 39% of corporate
banking borrowers, which excludes Ascentium and branch small business
customers, have made a payment while in deferral.

As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan
modifications related to COVID-19 beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier
of 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends
or December 31, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Refer to
Table 15 "Troubled Debt Restructurings" for further information.

As a certified SBA lender, Regions experienced a slight increase in lending
activity in the third quarter of 2020 as the Company continued to assist
customers through the loan process under the PPP. Under this program, Regions
has approximately 46,500 loans outstanding totaling approximately $4.6 billion
as of September 30, 2020.

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the
Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has
ample sources of liquidity that include a granular and stable deposit base,
cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal
Home Loan Bank, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing
availability at the Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity",
"Shareholders' Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further
information.

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. Consumer spending
increased moderately in the third quarter of 2020 as restrictions on economic
activity were eased throughout the country. While moderate increases to
consumer spending increased service charges and card and ATM fees compared to
the second quarter, spend remains below pre-pandemic levels. If current
spending levels persist, the Company estimates consumer service charges will
remain $30 million to $35 million per quarter behind prior-year levels. See
Table 28 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Regions assessed goodwill for impairment in light of the economic environment
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded that it was not more likely than
not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units was less than
its carrying value. Refer to the "Goodwill" section for further detail.

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has
effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail.

Supervisory Stress Test Update

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020. During the third quarter, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement
for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0
percent. On October 15, 2020, the Company declared a cash dividend for the
fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.155 per share, which was in compliance with the
Federal Reserve's SCB framework.

Third Quarter Results

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $501 million,
or $0.52 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $385
million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019.

For the third quarter of 2020, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis)
totaled $1.0 billion, up $50 million compared to the third quarter of 2019.
The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.13 percent for the
third quarter of 2020 and 3.44 percent in the third quarter of 2019. The
increase in net interest income was primarily driven by increases in loan
balances due to PPP lending, the Company's April 2020 equipment finance
acquisition, increased production of residential first mortgage

loans, a decrease in deposit costs, and decreases in short and long-term
borrowings through the redemption of Bank senior notes and paydowns of FHLB
advances. Net interest income also benefited from the execution of the
Company's interest rate hedging strategy. The decline in net interest margin
was primarily driven by elevated levels of cash held at the Federal Reserve
and the impact of lower yielding PPP loans. Additionally, net interest margin
was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the
securities portfolio at lower market interest rates.

The provision for credit losses totaled $113 million in the third quarter of
2020, as compared to the provision for loan losses of $108 million during the
third quarter of 2019. The current quarter provision matched net charge-offs.
Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

Net charge-offs totaled $113 million, or an annualized 0.50 percent of average
loans, in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $92 million, or an annualized
0.44 percent for the third quarter of 2019. The increase was driven primarily
by deterioration in the loan portfolio due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
inclusion of net charge-offs associated with the April 2020 equipment finance
acquisition. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"  to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The allowance was 2.74 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at
September 30, 2020 compared to 1.10 percent at December 31, 2019. The increase
was impacted by the adoption of CECL at the beginning of 2020 and other
factors discussed above, particularly the provisions recorded during the first
half of 2020. The allowance was 316 percent of total non-performing loans at
September 30, 2020 compared to 180 percent at December 31, 2019. Total non-
performing loans increased to 0.87 percent of total loans, net of unearned
income, at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.61 percent at December 31, 2019.
The increase in non-performing loans was driven primarily by downgrades in
retail IRE mortgage, administrative support, waste and repair, manufacturing,
restaurant and energy-related credits. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit
Losses" section for further detail.

Non-interest income was $655 million for the third quarter of 2020, a $97
million increase from the third quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily
driven by higher mortgage and capital markets income and a valuation gain on
an equity investment. The increases are partially offset by lower service
charges income. See Table 28 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail.

Total non-interest expense was $896 million in the third quarter of 2020, a
$25 million increase from the third quarter of 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by the April 2020 equipment finance acquisition. See Table 29
"Non-Interest Expense" for more detail.

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $104
million compared to $107 million for the same period in 2019. See "Income
Taxes" toward the end of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of
this report for more detail.

Expectations

Due to the current economic uncertainty, the Company has rescinded previously
issued financial targets for 2020, as well as the three-year targets
previously announced in 2019. Regions' expectations will continue to evolve in
response to the changing economic conditions presented amidst the COVID-19
pandemic, as the Company expects that the financial results of subsequent
quarters will continue to be impacted.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in
certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $9.4 billion from year-end
2019 to September 30, 2020, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit
with the FRB. Significant deposit growth during the second and third quarters
has contributed to historically elevated liquidity sources for the Company.
Commercial customer deposit levels have significantly increased as customers
have kept their PPP loans and brought excess deposits back to Regions.
Additionally, consumers have kept government stimulus payments as well as
continued to adjust their spending and saving behavior in response to the
economic environment. Some of these liquidity sources were used to maintain
cash at the FRB. See the "Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more
information.

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the
securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate
sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions
maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency
mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-
Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information.

Debt securities increased $4.3 billion from December 31, 2019 to September 30,
2020. Despite the interest rate volatility during the first nine months of
2020, Regions' comprehensive securities repositioning executed in late 2019
positioned the portfolio to react favorably to the current economic
environment. The increase from year-end was the result of improved market
valuation and purchases of mortgage-backed securities. During the third
quarter of 2020, as part of its cash deployment strategy, Regions added $2.6
billion of residential agency mortgage-backed securities and $391 million of
commercial agency mortgage-backed securities.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2020, consisting of
$1.1 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $117 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $5 million of non-performing loans.
At December 31, 2019, loans held for sale totaled $637 million, consisting of
$436 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $188 million of
commercial mortgage and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans.
The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for
sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate
depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties.

LOANS

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 68 percent of
Regions' interest-earning assets at September 30, 2020. The following table
presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by portfolio segment and
class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and
classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2019 year-end,
and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan
portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its
footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain
concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers
or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of
industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"  to the consolidated financial
statements for additional discussion.

Many classes within Regions' portfolio segments continue to experience the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are
ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the
economic impact as well as the effectiveness of the various government
programs in place to support individuals and businesses. See Tables 3 through
8 below for more detail.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to
commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working
capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial
and industrial loans increased $5.2 billion since year-end 2019. This balance
includes $4.6 billion of PPP loans generated in 2020 and the addition of $1.9
billion in loans related to the Ascentium acquisition that occurred at the
beginning of the second quarter of 2020 (see the "Ascentium Acquisition"
section for more information). In the first half of 2020, the portfolio
experienced elevated draws on commercial lines of credit. However, during the
third quarter of 2020, line utilization levels normalized and declined to
historic lows at the end of the third quarter.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans
to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and
buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations.
Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to
commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a
building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the
business of the borrower.

Over half of the Company's total loans are included in the commercial
portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as
noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this
portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry.

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in
selected industries.

"Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial
products that are real estate related.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
(2)

"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business
industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not
available at the loan level.  
  
|  
---|---  
  
(3)

|

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing
chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to
define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not
recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification
because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed
appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted.  
  
  

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Regions' risk management framework
provides for credit reviews to identify certain industry sectors within the
commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest
risk due to COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the third quarter of
2020, which narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to the second
quarter. As of September 30, 2020, these high-risk industries include energy,
healthcare, other consumer services, restaurants, travel and leisure, hotels
and retail. Industries identified as high-risk may change in future periods
depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over time.
These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within these
industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. PPP loan balances are not included
in Table 4 as these loans are not considered high risk. Regions is closely
monitoring customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these
customers. Certain of these exposures are also represented in Table 5 through
Table 8 below. All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio
segment, unless specifically identified as IRE.

Energy

Regions' direct energy portfolio is comprised mostly of E&P and midstream
sector borrowers. As of September 30, 2020, oil prices have rebounded from
all-time lows in April 2020, but have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels.
None of Regions' direct energy credits are leveraged loans and Regions has no
second lien energy exposure. During the first nine months of 2020, Regions has
recognized approximately $128 million in energy charge-offs, of which 80% is
associated with loans originated prior to 2016 and were unable to restructure
after the 2015 downturn. Since first quarter 2015, utilization rates have
remained between 40-60%. Hedge positions are adequate for oil producers and
strong for natural gas providers, and approximately 2% of energy loans are
currently operating under a COVID-19 payment deferral.

Restaurant

Quarantining, social distancing, and reduced business travel as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to result in lost demand, much of
which may not be recoverable. The quick service sector comprises over half of
Regions' restaurant portfolio balances outstanding. The $730 million in COVID
high-risk balances related to restaurants disclosed in Table 4 above is
included across various sectors in Table 6 below, with the casual dining
sector under the most stress in the current environment. Quick service
restaurants, which focus on fast food service and limited menus, have
performed relatively well during the pandemic given digital platforms, drive-
through and delivery capabilities. Approximately 20% of restaurant
outstandings are leveraged. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions
strategically exited some higher risk restaurant relationships at par.
Approximately 2% of restaurant, accommodation and lodging portfolio balances
are in payment deferrals as of September 30, 2020. During the first nine
months of 2020, Regions has recognized approximately $33 million in restaurant
charge-offs.

Hotel-related

Regions' hotel-related portfolio is primarily comprised of 11 REIT customers.
These loans are unsecured commercial and industrial loans; however, they are
real estate related. The REIT portfolio benefits from low leverage, strong
liquidity, and diversity of property holdings. Companies have also taken
proactive steps to reduce capital expenditures, cut dividends, and reduce
overhead to preserve cash. SNCs comprise 57% of Regions' total hotel-related
loans. Most of Regions' borrowers for secured hotel loans have requested
deferrals. As noted above, approximately 2% of restaurant, accommodation and
lodging portfolio balances are in payment deferrals as of September 30, 2020.
The consumer services and PPP balances included in the table below along with
the total restaurants balance in Table 6 above comprise the restaurant,
accommodation and lodging balance in Table 3 above.

Retail-related

Regions' retail-related industry is primarily comprised of REITs and non-
leveraged commercial and industrial sectors. Approximately $425 million of
outstanding balances across the REIT and IRE portfolios relate to shopping
malls and outlet centers. Portfolio exposure to REITs specializing in enclosed
malls consists of a small number of credits. Approximately 34% of mall REIT
balances are investment grade with low leverage. The IRE portfolio is widely
distributed. The largest tenants typically include "basic needs" anchors. The
commercial and industrial retail portfolio is also widely distributed. The
largest categories include motor vehicle and parts dealers, building
materials, garden equipment and supplies, and non-store retailers. Owner-
occupied CRE consists primarily of small strip malls and convenience stores
which are largely term loans where a higher utilization rate is expected. Less
than one percent of retail-related lending is operating in a deferral as of
September 30, 2020. During the first nine months of 2020, Regions has
recognized approximately $10 million in retail-related lending charge-offs.
The commercial and industrial leveraged and non-leveraged, asset-based
lending, PPP and CRE owner-occupied balances totaling $2,977 million in the
table below comprise the retail trade commercial industry sector balance in
Table 3.

Investor Real Estate

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the
operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes
extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is
dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate
collateral. A portion of Regions' investor real estate portfolio segment
consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family
and condominium loans) within Regions' markets. Additionally, this category
includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment
buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total
investor real estate loans increased $1.0 billion in comparison to 2019 year-
end balances reflecting new fundings and draws on investor real estate
construction lines.

Residential First Mortgage

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a
residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and,
in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence.
These loans increased $1.7 billion in comparison to 2019 year-end balances.
The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an
increase in originations due to historically low market interest rates during
2020. Approximately $5.4 billion in new loan originations were retained on the
balance sheet through the first nine months of 2020. In addition, Regions
repurchased approximately $340 million delinquent residential mortgage loans
from GNMA during the third quarter of 2020.

Home Equity Lines

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's
residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes.
Home equity lines decreased by $547 million in comparison to 2019 year-end
balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions'
branch network.

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year
draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period
customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very
limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had
a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home
equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment
upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity.
The term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments required
until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.

Table of Contents

  

  

The following table presents information regarding the future principal
payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of
September 30, 2020. The balances presented are based on maturity date for
lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that
convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the
borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow
customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans
decreased by $245 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances.
Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch
network.

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as
collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending
products ("current LTV"). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled
by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses
the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in
its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into
account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the
residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of
the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the
portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The
amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the
table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral, the
entire balance is included in the "Above 100%" category, regardless of the
amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party
business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive
dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $692 million from year-end 2019.
The decrease is due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the
fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue
its indirect auto lending business. Regions ceased originating new indirect
auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and completed any in-process indirect
auto loan closings at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will
remain in the direct auto lending business.

Indirect--Other Consumer

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through
third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio class decreased
$586 million from year-end 2019 due to exiting a third party relationship
during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consumer Credit Card

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest
rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $198 million from
year-end 2019 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as customers
react to the economic environment.

Other Consumer

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and
other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $187 million from year-
end 2019.

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores,
unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for
consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO
scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more
information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the
Allowance for Credit Losses" .

ALLOWANCE

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting
principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles
conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance (where applicable), and general banking
practices. The allowance is one of the most significant estimates and
assumptions to Regions. The allowance consists of two components: the
allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.
Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial
guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments.

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss
allowance methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. See Note 1
"Basis of Presentation", Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"
and Note 13 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for information about CECL
adoption, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the
allowance.

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as
modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio
performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to
external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by
changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate
demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health
pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural
disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.

Management considers these variables and all other available information when
establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have
the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally
estimated amounts.

Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, Regions has increased the
allowance by $1.0 billion from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion, which represents
management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and
credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the allowance are
presented in Table 11 below. While many of these items overlap regarding
impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

While the third quarter of 2020 showed signs of economic improvement, there
continues to be uncertainty surrounding the economic environment due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Credit metrics improved during the third quarter, and
deferrals and forbearance balances declined. Additionally, unprecedented
stimulus is working its way through the economic system, evidenced

  

70

by higher consumer spend in the current quarter. While economic growth
improved, the public health crisis is not resolved and continued economic
uncertainty remains. While the initial economic stimulus for those on
unemployment expired in the third quarter, a temporary stimulus was approved
at a slightly reduced rate and, many on unemployment had higher cash flows
than when they were employed. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well
and the HPI showed robust appreciation. As the credit risk within Regions'
loan portfolio continues to be evaluated for the remainder of 2020, both
negative and positive factors of the ever-evolving economic landscape were
considered in determining the allowance estimate.

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand
external macro-views of credit metrics, trends and industry outlooks as well
as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The third
quarter of 2020 exhibited some signs of improvement from the initial onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic, as commercial and investor real estate criticized
balances decreased approximately $491 million and total net charge-offs
decreased $69 million compared to the second quarter. Conversely, classified
balances increased $74 million and non-performing loans, excluding held for
sale, increased $153 million compared to the second quarter. Regions performed
a bottom-up review of commercial and IRE loan portfolios during the third
quarter, which resulted in fewer sectors considered high-risk compared to the
second quarter. As of September 30, 2020, $6.6 billion of commercial and
investor real estate loans are in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments, a
decline of $1.8 billion from June 30, 2020. These high-risk industries include
energy, healthcare, other consumer services, restaurants, travel and leisure,
unsecured and investor real estate hotels, unsecured retail and investor real
estate retail. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more
information about the high-risk industries.

Regions purchased Ascentium, an independent equipment financing company on
April 1, 2020. The purchase included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and
leases to small businesses, of which approximately 46% were considered to be
PCD. Regions considered loan payment status, COVID-19 deferral status, and
loans in high-risk industries in COVID-19 highly-impacted states in its
determination of PCD. The Ascentium acquisition resulted in $136 million in
additional allowance in the second quarter, of which $76 million was recorded
through the provision for credit losses and the remaining $60 million was for
acquired PCD loans and did not impact the provision for credit losses. See the
"Ascentium Acquisition" section for more information.

Changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the
allowance estimate under CECL. Regions' economic forecast utilized in the
January 1, 2020 allowance estimate upon adoption of CECL considered a
relatively benign economic environment. The forecast utilized in the March 31,
2020 allowance estimate considered a more stressed economic environment due to
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic based on early stage pandemic information.
The economic forecast utilized in the June 30, 2020 allowance estimate
included further deterioration primarily due to higher levels of unemployment.
The economic forecast utilized in the September 30, 2020 allowance estimate
includes normalization of economic activity, albeit at an uneven pace across
individual states and industry groups. Refer to the Economic Environment in
Regions' Banking Markets within the "Third Quarter Overview" section for more
information. Regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts
and external data available.

Risks to the economic forecast included a high degree of uncertainty around
how wide the COVID-19 pandemic could spread, how long it could persist, and if
any public health changes could trigger another round of shutdowns. In the
second quarter of 2020, the economic environment produced unintuitive modeled
results due to sensitivity to the unemployment forecasts, specifically the
transient spike in unemployment rates. The CECL models are not built or
conditioned to reflect the unprecedented levels of stimulus and cannot
anticipate (or connect) the new relationships between economic variables and
portfolio risks that existed during the second quarter. In the third quarter
of 2020, unemployment declined from the second quarter to more normalized, yet
elevated, forecasted levels and the CECL models reacted as directionally
expected. The normalized, yet elevated, trends in the third quarter were
considered to inform appropriate model adjustments for economic uncertainty.
Industry-level stress analyses were also performed on industries most acutely
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics"
section for more information about COVID-19 impacted industries.

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some
level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision
component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are
inherent in any modeling estimate. The September 30, 2020 general imprecision
allowance considered the incremental risk specific to the economic uncertainty
caused by COVID-19 on commercial and consumer models as well as the
incremental risk associated with payment deferrals for certain consumer models
that are not economically conditioned and as such do not fully consider these
impacts.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base
forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of September 30, 2020. The
unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL
models. Unemployment normalized in the third quarter as noted above and, after
reviewing updated factors, the Company determined that a current period
adjustment to the Base forecast for unemployment was not required.

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of
$2.4 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan
and credit commitment portfolios as of September 30, 2020.

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed their estimated modeled credit
losses for Regions as a part of the supervisory stress test. The Federal
Reserve's economic scenario resulted in estimated losses for Regions of $5.3
billion. Whereas this scenario assumed a different macroeconomic outlook than
Regions', it may represent a possible range of potential credit losses
assuming a longer-term, widespread pandemic. As a point of clarification, the
Federal Reserve's scenario assumes severe deterioration across both business
services (commercial and investor real estate) and consumer portfolios, while
Regions assumes deterioration mainly in the business services portfolio.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve's estimate includes no benefit of government
stimulus or benefit from debt payment relief being offered by Regions and
other financial institutions. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for
further information regarding the Company's economic outlook.

Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of
the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance
to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory
agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the
level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in
certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in
circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or
certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The
scenarios discussed above, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in
actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally
estimated amounts. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in
economic conditions, including changes resulting from various pandemic
scenarios, the impact of government stimulus, and other relief programs could
affect borrower behavior. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in
the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and
imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.

  

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of
activity from the previous year's totals, are included in Table 13 "Allowance
for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates,
unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well
as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the CARES
Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net
charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the
remainder of 2020 and beyond.

the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to
retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets. See Note 1 for

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. As provided in the CARES Act passed into
law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19
pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the end
of the pandemic or December 31, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR
classification. Regions elected this provision of the CARES Act; therefore,
modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered
TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below.

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments
are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. During this time, a
customer's loan is not considered past due and continues to accrue interest
(unless it is a nonperforming loan). As of September 30, 2020, the initial
90-day deferral period had expired for the majority of COVID-19 modified
loans. See the "Third Quarter Overview" section for details on deferrals as of
September, 30, 2020. Upon expiration of the deferral period, customers may
apply for additional relief or resume making payments on their loans.
Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on the loan type and
repayment ability of the borrower. The CARES Act relief and short-term nature
of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded these modifications from being classified
as TDRs as of September 30, 2020.

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other
consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and
investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal
program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a
workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real
estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate
is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market.
Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information
is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"  to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan
balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the
periods presented:

Table of Contents

  

  

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and
investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the
definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were
first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures,
payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from
TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial
difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the
loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been
reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently
refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new
loan.

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions
from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the
types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note
3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"  to the consolidated financial
statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition
will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified
through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the
loan.

(1) The majority of this category consists of payments and sales. It also
includes normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments, loans
transferred to held for sale, removals and reclassifications between portfolio
segments. Additionally, it includes $18 million of commercial loans and $12
million of investor real estate loans refinanced or restructured as new loans
and removed from TDR classification for the nine months ended September 30,
2020. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, $4 million of
commercial loans and $1 million of investor real estate loans were refinanced
or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification.

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA
and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but not
the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans
excluded were $47 million at September 30, 2020 and $66 million at December
31, 2019.  
  
Non-performing loans at September 30, 2020 have increased compared to year-end
levels, primarily driven by downgrades in retail IRE mortgage, energy and
restaurant loans, all of which, have experienced stress due to recent declines
in demand brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity
prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-
performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could
also result in volatility.

At September 30, 2020, Regions estimates that the amount of commercial and
investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual
status in the next quarter is within the range of $150 million to $250
million.

In order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the
next quarter, credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may
potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending upon the
occurrence of future events. A variety of factors are included in the
assessment of potential problem loans, including a borrower's capacity and
willingness to meet contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments
or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and
complete financial information, including global cash flows, contingent
liabilities and sources of liquidity. For other loans (for example, smaller
dollar loans), a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate
of potential future downgrades. In addition, the economic environment and
industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of
potential problem loans for the next quarter. Current trends will additionally
influence the size of the estimated range. Because of the inherent uncertainty
in forecasting future events, the estimated range of potential problem loans
ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans, as
opposed to an individual listing of loans.

Many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are
considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard
accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 3
"Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses"  to the consolidated financial
statements.

held for sale) by portfolio segment:

GOODWILL

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at September 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion at
December 31, 2019 and is allocated to each of Regions' reportable segments
(each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on
an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair
value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer
to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill
for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to
determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit). The increase in
goodwill from December 31, 2019 was related to the Company's acquisition of
Ascentium during the second quarter of 2020.

The result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of 2020 did not
indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units
(Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their
respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of
goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions' reporting units for
the September 30, 2020 interim period. Refer to Note 5 "Goodwill" to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

DEPOSITS

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a
share of the deposit market. Regions' ability to compete in the deposit market
depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company
meets customers' needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and
enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service,
competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions
also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking
services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet
banking.

Total deposits at September 30, 2020 increased approximately $21.0 billion
compared to year-end 2019 levels, due to increases in non-interest-bearing
demand, savings, interest-bearing transaction and domestic money market
categories. These increases were partially offset by decreases in corporate
treasury other deposits and customer time deposits. Non-interest-bearing
demand deposits continued to increase as customers have been bringing their
elevated cash levels back to Regions. Also, businesses are focused on supply
chain efficiencies and turnover of receivables which has increased their cash
balances and resulting deposits. Savings, interest-bearing transaction and
domestic money market categories increased due to customers choosing to keep
excess cash from government stimulus and funds from PPP loans in their deposit
accounts. Additionally, consumers' spending has declined due to the economic
environment and consumers continue to adjust their spending and saving
patterns, which has led to an increase in deposit balances. Customer time
deposits decreased due to maturities during the third quarter, and continued
lower interest rates during the third quarter resulted in a decrease in the
utilization of time deposit accounts. Corporate treasury other deposits
decreased as these deposits were used to supplement incremental balance sheet
funding at year-end 2019, but were not utilized at the end of the third
quarter of 2020.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, were zero at September
30, 2020 as compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The levels of these
borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the
sources utilized. FHLB borrowings decreased from December 31, 2019 to
September 30, 2020 as the increase in deposits reduced the need for funding
from the FHLB.

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions funding strategy.
The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances
continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity"
section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings decreased by approximately $3.0 billion since year-end
2019, due primarily to the decrease in FHLB advances of $2.5 billion, as well
as several other debt transactions. As mentioned above in the "Short-Term
Borrowings" section, the increase in deposits also reduced the need for long-
term borrowings from the FHLB. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail
of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB. In the second quarter of 2020,
Regions issued $750 million of senior notes due 2025. The issuance was more
than offset by partial tenders and redemptions executed in the second and
third quarters of 2020. In the second quarter, Regions executed a partial
tender of the two Regions Bank Senior Notes due April 2021. In the third
quarter, Regions redeemed the two Regions Bank Senior Notes due August 2021 in
their entirety. In conjunction with the partial tenders and redemptions of
bank notes and early terminations of FHLB advances, Regions incurred related
early extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $8 million for the first nine
months of 2020. Lastly, through the Ascentium acquisition, Regions acquired
securitized borrowings, which the Company will manage within its broader
liability management process and in line with the allowable terms of the
contracts.

Long-term FHLB advances had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.9 percent at
December 31, 2019.

The Ascentium note securitizations have various classes and have a weighted-
average interest rate of 2.25 percent as of September 30, 2020, with remaining
maturities ranging from 3 years to 7 years and a weighted-average of 6.0
years.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shareholders' equity was $17.9 billion at September 30, 2020 as compared to
$16.3 billion at December 31, 2019. During the first nine months of 2020, net
income increased shareholders' equity by $478 million, cash dividends on
common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $447 million and cash dividends
on preferred stock reduced shareholder's equity by $75 million. The cumulative
effect from the adoption of CECL decreased shareholders' equity by $377
million. See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" for information about the CECL
adoption. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased
shareholders' equity by $1.7 billion, primarily due to the net change in
unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative
instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. The derivative instruments are hedges
designed to protect net interest income in a low short-term interest rate
environment, such as the one that currently exists. Lastly, during the second
quarter of 2020, the Company issued Series D preferred stock, which increased
shareholders' equity by $346 million.

See Note 6 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
and the "Regulatory Capital Requirements" section for additional information.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital
requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These
regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's
assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory
actions.

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach
bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to
Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking
agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is
included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion
and Analysis in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is
also included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to
the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule
related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule
allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-
year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over
the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial
adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At
September 30, 2020, the impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $611
million, or approximately 56 basis points.

regulatory requirements:

(1) The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,
and Leverage capital ratios are estimated.

  

In October of 2020, the SCB framework, that was finalized in the first quarter
of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk
sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help
determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5%
to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result of this
rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital
Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5% in addition to the minimum risk-
weighted asset ratios shown above.

During the third quarter, the Federal Reserve finalized Regions' SCB
requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021
at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the amount of capital
degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, inclusive of four
quarters of planned common stock dividends.

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential
standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters
related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under
these rules. See the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business"
section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

  

LIQUIDITY

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to
effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management
principals, as well as regulatory requirements as applicable to Regions'
Category IV status under the tailoring rules. Regions' framework establishes
sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate,
monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions' Liquidity
Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the
Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are
not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, cash flow
forecasting, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency
funding plans, and collateral management. The framework is designed to
simultaneously meet the expectations of regulations, as well as be aligned
with Regions' business mix and operating model and their impact to liquidity
management.

On April 3, 2020, Moody's revised outlooks for Regions Bank and Regions
Financial Corporation to stable from positive citing expectations for a
contracting economy in 2020 which is expected to have a direct negative impact
on U.S. banks' asset quality and profitability.

On April 9, 2020, Fitch revised the outlook for Regions Financial Corporation
to stable from positive as part of an overall revision of its U.S. bank sector
and rating outlook. Revision to the overall outlook was driven by concerns
over the negative financial and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality,
business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of
earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may
impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions' access
to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity,
collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby
potentially adversely impacting Regions' financial condition and liquidity.
See the "Risk Factors" section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019 for more information.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and
the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial
measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures include "adjusted average total loans", "ending total loans excluding
PPP, net", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted efficiency
ratio", "adjusted fee income ratio", "return on average tangible common
shareholders' equity", and end of period "tangible common shareholders'
equity", and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and
certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a
meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes
will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and
predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used
by management to assess the performance of Regions' business because
management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be
indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these
non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of
the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and
the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

|  
---|---  
  
•

|

Preparation of Regions' operating budgets  
  
|  
---|---  
  
•

Presentations to investors of Company performance  
  
Average total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer exit
portfolio, and indirect vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average
total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average total loans
provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on
the same basis as that applied by management.

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans
originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to
loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss
allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S.
government, are excluded from total loans.

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity,
is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted
total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio
(non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by
adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these
ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful
information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding
adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is
the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is
presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income
(non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are
added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted
efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.

Tangible common shareholders' equity ratios have become a focus of some
investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects
of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve
and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank's capital adequacy
based on CET1, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking
regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions' capital
adequacy using the tangible common shareholders' equity measure. Because
tangible common shareholders' equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this
measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities
may calculate it differently than Regions' disclosed calculations. Since
analysts and banking

regulators may assess Regions' capital adequacy using tangible common
shareholders' equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors
the ability to assess Regions' capital adequacy on this same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be
uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial
measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company,
they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not
represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans
(GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of
ending total loans (GAAP) to ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP)
and a computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 3) a
reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common
shareholders (GAAP), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to
adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net interest
income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest
income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of
non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a
computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of the
adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the adjusted fee
income ratio (non-GAAP), and 9) a reconciliation of average and ending
shareholders' equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common
shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

The increase in net interest income for the third quarter 2020 compared to the
same period in 2019 was driven by increases in loan balances attributable to
PPP lending, the Company's April 2020 equipment finance company acquisition,
increased production of residential first mortgage loans, a decrease in
deposit costs, and decreases in short and long-term borrowings through the
redemption of Bank senior notes and paydowns of FHLB advances. Net interest
income also benefitted from the execution of the Company's interest rate
hedging strategy. The hedges are designed to protect net interest income in a
low short-term interest rate environment, such as the one that currently
exists, and had a positive impact of approximately $163 million for the first
nine months

of 2020, of which $94 million was realized in the three months ended September
30, 2020. The hedging strategy produced no benefits before 2020.

The declines in net interest margin for the third quarter 2020 and the first
nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019, were primarily
driven by elevated cash levels, increases in loan balances due to PPP lending
and loan production at lower market interest rates. Additionally, net interest
margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios
and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates.

MARKET RISK--INTEREST RATE RISK

Regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty
with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest
rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various
yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company
offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest
income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario.
Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-
term indicator of Regions' interest rate risk.

Sensitivity Measurement--Financial simulation models are Regions' primary
tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of
sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive
information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes
in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual
characteristics of Regions' balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the
direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and
the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic
plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of
balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics
of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest
rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the
pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions
considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to
coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to
sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest
rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions
compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base
case scenario derived using "market forward rates." The standard set of
interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate
shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical
standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most
yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based
on historical minimums as explained in the following section. In addition to
parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are
contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements
phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed
of potential interest rate movements.

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements--As of September 30, 2020, Regions was
modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield
curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending
September 2021. The third quarter continued the trend of strong balance sheet
growth in low-cost deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve.
These trends increase reported asset sensitivity levels in the near-term;
however, this is offset somewhat by the addition of approximately $3 billion
of fixed-rate investment securities (Agency MBS and Agency CMBS) within the
quarter.

The estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table
below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term
interest rates. The decline in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed
Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR) will
lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to
such rates. Under that environment, it is expected that declines in funding
costs and increases in balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the
decline in asset yields. Therefore, net interest income sensitivity to short-
term rates is approximately neutral. Net interest income remains exposed to
longer yield curve tenors. A reduction in intermediate and long-term interest
rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage
rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or
renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio
purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities
in the investment portfolio.

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield
curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are
inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting
hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start
within the measurement horizon. More information regarding forward starting
hedges is disclosed in Table 26 and its accompanying description.

The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12 month average rate
shock of -16 basis points and -80 basis points to approximately zero for 1
month LIBOR and the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield, respectively. Mortgage yield
shocks are floored at their historical minimums minus 35 basis points.  
  
As market interest rates increased in recent years, Regions had established
scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The
shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equated
to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate 35 basis points lower
than the historical all-time minimum. Recent market volatility and new
historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors have resulted in a
shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to approximately zero.
Mortgage rates, which have retained somewhat elevated levels, are still being
shocked in the manner previously described. Further, the scenarios presented
do not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 25 above
quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under
this environment.

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table
25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the
progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the
scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there
are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those
pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet
composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated
with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity,
management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key
assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be
considered to be predictive of future results.

The Company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan growth and
deposit normalization reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of
deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by
analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on
management's expectations in the current environment. In the base case
scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 25, interest-bearing deposit
rates move into the single digits. In rising rate scenarios only, management
assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case balance
sheet assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management
assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to
interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate
dependent and equates to approximately $3 billion over 12 months in the
gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 25. Since the end of 2019, Regions
has seen sizable deposit growth, which has contributed to its higher interest
rate risk sensitivity year-to-date. The Company estimates that every $1
billion decline in total deposit balances would reduce NII sensitivity in
Table 25 by approximately -$8 million and +$2 million in the gradual +100
basis point and the gradual -100 basis point floored shock scenarios,
respectively. While estimates should be used as a guide, differences may
result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market competitive
factors.

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions'
securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of
shareholders' equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price
movements with derivatives (as discussed below).

Derivatives--Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of
interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions' senior
management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate
sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging
strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with
customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange
risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts,
Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.

Table of Contents

  

  

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at
a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is
a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions
to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures
contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with
Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically
entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a
reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are
contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a
predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-
upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency
for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are
executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to
manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the
credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet
hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding
position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives
to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its
mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the
origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the
potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect
the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in
interest rates and pricing.

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest
rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination of
short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1 month LIBOR.  
  
A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in Table 26 above
are forward starting as of September 30, 2020, including $1.0 billion notional
of the outstanding cash flow swaps and $250 million notional of the
outstanding cash flow floors. Forward starting swaps and floors have
maturities of approximately five years from their respective start dates, and
further information regarding the timeline for start dates has been disclosed
in Table 27. During the third quarter, Regions unwound $1 billion notional of
interest rate floors at a gain, which will be amortized throughout the life of
the original instrument, or approximately five years. This action was
performed to partially offset the asset duration increases provided by the $3
billion securities portfolio additions within the quarter.

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts with start dates
prior to the year-end periods shown through 2026. All cash flow hedge notional
amounts mature prior to the end of 2027.

As of September 30, 2020, $15.0 billion of the $16.0 billion notional of the
cash flow swaps and $5.50 billion of the $5.75 billion notional of the
interest rate floors are active. During the fourth quarter of 2020, $250
million notional of interest rate swaps become active. The remaining $750
million notional of interest rate swaps and $250 million notional of interest
rate floors become active in the first quarter of 2021.  
  
Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as
it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits
for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer
transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is
evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the
financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced
significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements.
When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a
legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents
the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from
and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives
traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for
cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the
clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in
place at the respective clearinghouse. The "Credit Risk" section in Regions'
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains more
information on the management of credit risk.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest
rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most
common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with
similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility
associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held
in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated
statements of income.

The primary objective of Regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact
of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income
and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of
these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of
Regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty
credit risk and changes in interest rates.

See Note 9 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the
consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions' quarter-
end derivatives positions and further discussion.

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to
fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into
derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value
fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into
in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of
Regions' current portfolio.

LIBOR Transition--In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates
LIBOR, announced that by the end of 2021, panel banks will no longer be
required to submit estimates that are used to construct LIBOR, confirming that
the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. Regions
holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR,
including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate obligations,
and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The
Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated
leadership and staff, with all relevant business lines and support groups
engaged. As part of this program, the Company continues to identify, assess,
and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation, unavailability, or non-
representativeness of LIBOR. Regions is also coordinating with regulatory
agencies and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for
contracts expiring after 2021, and preparing for this transition as it relates
to both new and existing exposures. Significant uncertainty remains; however,
steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by
Regions' Executive LIBOR Steering Committee. Continuing activities of the
LIBOR Transition Program include facilitating the transition of all financial
and strategic processes, systems, and models; performing assessments of the
transition's impact to contracts and products; evaluating necessary
operational and infrastructure enhancements to implement alternative benchmark
rates; and coordinating communications with customers. In the third quarter of
2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions
that reference LIBOR. See Note 13 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the
consolidated financial statements for details.

MARKET RISK--PREPAYMENT RISK

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment
speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments.
Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net
interest income . For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may
be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at
lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate
environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets.
Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions' interest income
and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these
assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not
having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also
impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions'
greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed
securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the
residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements.
Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which
are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in
policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S.
Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage
market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing
dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may
be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and
manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all
such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk
that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income
on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part
of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk
management.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and
affects Regions' ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal
requirements of its customers. Regions maintains strong liquidity levels that
position the Company to respond to stressed environments. As discussed below,
Regions has a variety of liquidity sources, which it continues to utilize to
fund customer needs.

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the
economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the
establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the
PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its
customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending
institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company
through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.
As of September 30, 2020, Regions has not used the Paycheck Protection Program
Liquidity Facility.

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from
normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential
litigation contingencies. See Note 12 "Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion
of the Company's funding requirements.

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders' equity. Regions' goal in liquidity
management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and
borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company's cash flow needs in
normal and stressed conditions. Having and using various sources of liquidity
to satisfy the Company's funding requirements is important.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions
performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at
the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy
requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater
of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash
balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company
totaled $2.5 billion at September 30, 2020. Compliance with the holding
company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a
quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank
and subsidiaries. These minimum requirements are informed by internal stress
testing measures which are reflective of Regions' portfolio and business mix.
The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any
reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established by the
Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's
Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions' primary sources of liquidity.
Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities
provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt
Securities"to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various
secured borrowing capacities.

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions'
liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base.
Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money
markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured
sources of funding.

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line
item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." At September 30, 2020,
Regions had approximately $11.4 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an
increase from approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019, due to the
significant increase in deposits associated with government programs offered
in relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for
more information.

Table of Contents

  

  

Regions' borrowing availability with the FRB as of September 30, 2020, based
on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $13.7 billion.

Regions' financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in
managing the Company's liquidity position. As of September 30, 2020, Regions
had no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled
approximately $16.8 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the
amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain
eligible securities and loans as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances.
Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of
outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a
reliable and economical source of funding.

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be
utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities.
Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10
billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one
time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements
in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring
outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately
negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory
approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

CREDIT RISK

Regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio
that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an
economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as
described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio,
Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes,
the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets,
as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a
discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security
risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks
that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial
institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally
increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of
reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, increase in
technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the
growing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to conduct
more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication and
activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists
and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify
and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its
information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and
vulnerabilities to its environment, so it can update and maintain its systems
and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls
are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and
transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing
practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure
its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the
resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue
to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to
evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or
unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a
comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and
oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest
increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from
outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment
has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these
events.

Regions' system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide
protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security
matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient
resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively
engaged in the oversight of Regions' continuous efforts to reinforce and
enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their
oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security
threat landscape. The Board monitors Regions' information management risk
policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee, which oversees
areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks
associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and
oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments,
strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity,
and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board's Audit Committee
regularly reviews Regions' cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving
reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the Chief
Information Security Officer, Risk Management, and Internal Audit. The Board
annually reviews the information security program and, through its various
committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters.

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to
gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions
to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is
a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services
sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third
party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability
and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so
information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to
other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC,
Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its
members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and
fraud topics.

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation.
These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions
in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant
resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these
measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure,
Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading
consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also
developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans
that it could implement in the event of a cyber event to mitigate the effects
of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. Some of Regions'
financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by
applicable insurance.

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the
Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information
being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have
transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations
and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In
addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of
its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and
monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions'
reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required
to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs,
costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any
reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil
litigation arising from the event.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan
losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in
management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the
contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance
sheet date. Regions adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, Regions
classified the provision for unfunded credit losses as provision for credit
losses. Prior to 2020, the provision for unfunded credit losses was included
in non-interest expense. The provision for credit losses totaled $113 million
in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses of $108
million during the third quarter of 2019. The provision for credit losses
totaled $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the
provision for loan losses of $291 million during the first nine months of
2019. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail.

In the third quarter of 2020, the equity investee executed an initial public
offering. However, the Company is subject to a conventional post-issuance 180
day lock-up period, which prevents the sale of its position.  
  
  

Service charges on deposit accounts--Service charges on deposit accounts
include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service
charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related
service charges. The decreases during the third quarter and first nine months
of 2020 compared to the same periods of 2019 were the result of lower customer
spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government stimulus programs resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic aided in the increase of customer deposits,
elevation of customer liquidity and also resulted in a reduction in overdraft
charges. Although

  

96

  

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

consumer spending has begun to normalize, if spend levels continue at the
current pace, service charges on deposit accounts will continue to be
negatively impacted in comparison to the prior year levels. See the "Third
Quarter Overview" section for further detail.

Card and ATM fees--Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit
card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. In the third
quarter of 2020, card and ATM fees recovered to prior year levels, primarily
driven by debit card spending. However, card and ATM fees decreased for the
first nine months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. The decline
was due to decreases in bank card and consumer credit card income in the first
and second quarters of 2020 as a result of declines in debit and credit card
spending and transaction volumes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although card and ATM fees are beginning to recover, if fee levels continue at
the current pace, they will continue to be lower on a year-to-date basis as
compared to the prior year levels.

Capital markets income--Capital markets income primarily relates to capital
raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan
syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger
and acquisition and other advisory services. The increases in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods of 2019,
were primarily driven by increases in debt and equity underwriting and
positive market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to credit
derivatives within commercial swap income. During both the third quarter of
2020 and first nine months of 2020, positive valuation adjustments totaled $5
million, compared to negative adjustments of $6 million for the third quarter
of 2019 and $15 million the first nine months of 2019. Capital markets income
also benefited from an increase in fees generated from the placement of
permanent financing for real estate during the the first nine months of 2020
as compared to the first nine months of the prior year.

Mortgage income--Mortgage income is generated through the origination and
servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increases in mortgage
income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same
periods of 2019 were due to increased loan production and sales income as
lower interest rates during the current quarter and first nine months of 2020
drove higher loan application volume.

Bank-owned life insurance--Bank-owned life insurance decreased in the first
nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to a
decrease in claims benefits in the first quarter of 2020 and favorable market
adjustments in the first quarter of 2019.

Securities gains (losses), net--Net securities gains (losses) primarily result
from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt
Securities" section for additional information.

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets--Market value adjustments
on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and other, are the reflection
of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee
benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit assets - other are
offset in salaries and benefits. Changes to market valuation adjustments in
2020 compared to 2019 were driven by the overall performance of the equity
markets. Furthermore, the Company repositioned its defined employee benefits
assets portfolio during the second quarter of 2019 into investments that are
no longer subject to the volatility of the equity markets.

Valuation gain on equity investment--Valuation gain on equity investment is
associated with an unrealized holding gain on an equity investment in a
company which executed an initial public offering during the third quarter of
2020. However, the Company is subject to a conventional post-issuance 180-day
lockup period, which prevents the sale of its position and is therefore
reflected in the investment valuation.

Other miscellaneous income--Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue
from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other
than the item referenced above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and
other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes
actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing
investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related
impairment charges.

(1) Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses
presented within net interest income after provision for credit losses is the
sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit
commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded
commitments was included in other non-interest expense.

  

Salaries and employee benefits--Salaries and employee benefits consist of
salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and
other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and
disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee
benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased during the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in
2019, driven primarily by higher production-based incentives, the addition of
associates through the Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition and
annual merit raises that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. Also
contributing to the increase for the first nine months of 2020 was increased
pay related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Full-time equivalent headcount increased

2019, primarily due to the addition of approximately 450 associates from the
Company's April 2020 equipment finance acquisition offset by headcount
reductions elsewhere.

Net occupancy expense--Net occupancy expense includes rent, depreciation, ad
valorem taxes, utilities, insurance, and maintenance. Net occupancy expense
decreased during the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in
2019 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the shelter in
place orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furniture and equipment expense--Furniture and equipment expense includes
depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of
equipment utilized by Regions and its affiliates. Furniture and equipment
expense increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020
compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in rental
expenses and maintenance and repairs related to investments in technology.

Outside services--Outside services consists of expenses related to routine
services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs,
data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data
subscriptions, and check printing. Outside services decreased during the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019
due primarily to Regions exiting a third party lending relationship in late
2019.

Credit/checkcard expenses--Credit/checkcard expenses include credit and
checkcard fraud and expenses. Credit/checkcard expenses decreased during the
third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in
2019 primarily due to a decline in checkcard fraud.

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges--Branch consolidation,
property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned
branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and
lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the
actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges
also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives.

Visa class B shares expense--Visa class B shares expense is associated with
shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to
the finalization of certain covered litigation. Visa class B shares expense
increased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in
2019 as a result of increases in Visa's stock price.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt--During the third quarter of 2020,
Regions incurred pre-tax early extinguishment charges totaling $2 million
related to the redemption of $1.0 billion in Regions Bank senior notes and
early terminations of all remaining FHLB advances. Additionally, during the
second quarter of 2020, Regions executed the partial debt extinguishment of
two Bank senior notes and early terminations of certain FHLB advances,
incurring related early extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $6 million.
See the "Long-Term Borrowings" section for additional information.

Other miscellaneous expenses--Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses
related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs,
foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses
and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other
miscellaneous expenses decreased during the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to lower
operational losses, declines in expenses related to non-service related
pension costs and lower expenses associated with limited travel as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

INCOME TAXES

The Company's income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020
was $104 million compared to $107 million for the three months ended September
30, 2019, resulting in effective tax rates of 16.5 percent and 20.6 percent,
respectively. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2020 was $99 million compared to $305 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, resulting in effective tax rates of 17.1 percent and 20.3
percent, respectively. The effective tax rates are lower in both current year
periods due primarily to a consistent level of permanent income tax
preferences having a proportionally larger impact relative to pre-tax
earnings, which were negatively impacted in the current year because of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the
level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions
with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing
investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible
expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may
occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such
as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments,
valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits.
Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may
be impacted.

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL. This resulted in an adjustment
to the opening balance of the allowance. The tax impact of this adjustment
increased deferred tax assets by approximately $126 million. See Note 1 "Basis
of Presentation" to the consolidated financial statements for further
information.

At September 30, 2020, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of
$517 million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $328 million at
December 31, 2019. The increase in the net deferred tax liability was
primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains on derivative instruments and
available for sale securities, partially offset by an increase in the deferred
tax asset related to the allowance.

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance
company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to
increase business loans and leases to small business customers using
Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities.

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of
assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired,
$1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial
and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were
long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of
the borrowings, and as of September 30, 2020, $406 million of long-term debt
remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair value.

These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of September 30,
2020. Fair value estimates, including loans, intangible assets and goodwill,
are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as
additional information becomes available.

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on
the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than
insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered
to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price
less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is
recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition,
which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related
to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset
value as part of the acquisition.

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value
mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the
contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The
amortization will not be material.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of
$348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. In the third quarter
of 2020, goodwill declined $6 million due to purchase accounting adjustments.
Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other
intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life
of each recognized asset.

Item 3\. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Reference is made to pages 91 through 95 included in Management's Discussion
and Analysis.

Item 4\. Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,
under the supervision and with the participation of Regions' management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Regions'
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. During the quarter ended
September 30, 2020, there have been no changes in Regions' internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, Regions' internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1\. Legal Proceedings

Information required by this item is set forth in Note 12, "Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited) in Part I. Item 1\. of this report, which is
incorporated by reference.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risk, some of which, including market,
liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic
risks, could be substantial and is inherent in our business. This risk also
includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease
considerably, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment
could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below is a risk factor that could
adversely affect Regions' financial results and condition, as well as the
value of, and return on investment in the Company, that was not included in
Part II, Item 1A of the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K as it arose after the
filing.

Our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of
operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have
adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our
business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations.
We cannot predict at this time the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will
continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity,
capital and results of operations. The extent of any continued or future
adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments,
which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and
duration of the pandemic (including the possibility of further resurgences or
waves of COVID-19), the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our
employees, clients, customers, counterparties and service providers, as well
as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities
and other third parties in response to the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to (i) increased unemployment and
decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased
risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; (ii) sudden and significant
declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (iii)
ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries,
including transportation, natural resources (in particular oil and gas),
hospitality and commercial real estate; (iv) significant draws on credit lines
as customers seek to increase liquidity; (v) significant reductions in the
targeted federal funds rate (which was reduced to a target rate of between
zero and 0.25% in the first quarter and may be reduced to below zero if the
Federal Reserve determines economic conditions warrant); (vi) increased
spending on our business continuity efforts, which may in turn require that we
further cut costs and investments in other areas; and (vii) heightened
cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-
from-home arrangements. In addition, we also face an increased risk of client
disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and
actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions re-opened branches for walk-in services.
As branch lobbies re-open, Regions continues to keep measures in place to help
ensure associate and customer safety. Approximately 90% of non-branch
associates are continuing to work remotely. If these measures are not
effective in serving our customers or affect the productivity of our
associates, they may lead to significant disruptions in our business
operations.

Many of our counterparties and third-party service providers have also been,
and may further be, affected by "stay-at-home" or similar orders, market
volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption
or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any
agreements with us or provide essential services. Even in areas in which stay-
at-home or similar orders have been eased or lifted, resurgence of COVID-19
may require such measures to be re-imposed at a later time. As a result, our
operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until
the pandemic subsides.

We have experienced an increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and
malicious traffic from outside the United States. Our layered control
environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related
to these events to date. Our information security risks are generally expected
to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.

We are offering special financial assistance to support customers who are
experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including
waivers of certain withdrawal fees from time deposits and savings and money
market accounts, loan payment deferrals and extensions, credit card payment
extensions, and consumer mortgage payment forbearance and payment deferment.
If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on borrowers, we may experience higher rates of default and increased
credit losses in future periods. In addition, in many cases, the initial
periods of payment deferrals, extensions, and forbearances have ended, which
may require us to provide additional assistance or lead to higher rates of
default and increased credit losses.

Additionally, we are a certified and qualified SBA lender and have provided
approximately $4.6 billion in PPP loans. These assistance efforts may
adversely affect our revenue and results of operations and may make our
results more difficult to forecast as the PPP forgiveness process has just
begun and the timing and amount of forgiveness to which our borrowers will be
entitled

cannot be predicted. The PPP and other government programs in which we may
participate are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and
regulatory scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Further,
Regions has been named in lawsuits in connection with its participation in the
PPP and may be named in additional lawsuits in the future.

Certain industries where Regions has credit exposure, including restaurants,
hotels, and commercial retail, have experienced and in some cases are
continuing to experience, significant operational challenges as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic. These operational challenges could result in corporate
lending clients making higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit,
which may negatively affect our liquidity. The effects of the COVID-19
pandemic may also cause our commercial customers to be unable to pay their
loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral, which we expect
would cause significant increases in our credit losses. The pandemic may also
alter consumer behavior, including spending patterns both in the short term
and the long term. Accordingly, certain of these industries may continue to be
negatively impacted even after the pandemic has subsided.

Our earnings and cash flows are dependent to a large degree on net interest
income (the difference between interest income from loans and investments and
interest expense on deposits and borrowings). Net interest income is
significantly affected by market rates of interest. The significant reductions
to the federal funds rate has led to a decrease in the rates and yields on
U.S. Treasury securities. If interest rates are reduced further in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that our net interest income will decline,
perhaps significantly. The overall effect of lower interest rates cannot be
predicted at this time and depends on future actions the Federal Reserve may
take to increase or reduce the targeted federal funds rate in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting economic conditions.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and market conditions
initially increased demands on our liquidity as we met our customers' and
clients' needs. During the third quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve has
required large banks, including Regions, to preserve capital by suspending
share repurchases, capping dividend payments at the amount paid in the second
quarter, and further limiting dividends according to a formula based on recent
net income. In addition, the Federal Reserve is requiring large banks,
including Regions, to update and resubmit their capital plans later this year
to reflect current economic stresses. The Federal Reserve has indicated that
it will evaluate these resubmitted plans and that it may extend the
restrictions on capital actions on a quarter-by-quarter basis as the economic
situation continues to evolve. We must comply with these restrictions and will
otherwise continue to exercise prudent capital management and monitor the
business environment. In particular, if the Federal Reserve extends the
dividend restriction that is based on recent net income, and the pandemic
continues or worsens, it may be difficult for us to maintain our dividend at
its current level.

The COVID-19 pandemic may impact our assessment of our goodwill. During the
third quarter of 2020, Regions concluded that it was not more likely than not
that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying
value, therefore a test of goodwill impairment was not required for any of
Regions' reporting units. Risks to our goodwill assessment are generally
expected to continue until the pandemic subsides.

Governmental authorities worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to
stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The ultimate success of
these measures remains unknown and these measures may not be sufficient to
address the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or avert severe and
prolonged reductions in economic activity.

Other negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business,
financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations cannot be
predicted at this time, but it is likely that our business, financial
condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will continue to be
adversely affected until the pandemic subsides and the U.S. economy fully
recovers. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of
heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled "Risk
Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Until the pandemic subsides, we expect
continued draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues from our lending
businesses, increased credit losses in our lending portfolios and decreased
fee income. Even after the pandemic subsides, it is possible that the U.S. and
other major economies continue to experience a prolonged recession, which we
expect would materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations.

Item 2\. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

On June 27, 2019, Regions announced the Board authorization of the repurchase
of up to $1.370 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting repurchases
from the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the third
quarter of 2020. Regions did not repurchase any outstanding common stock
during the three month period ended September 30, 2020, and given the
uncertainty in the overall economic environment as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, no share repurchases are currently anticipated for 2020.

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that the Company exceeded all
minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. The capital plan
submitted to the Federal Reserve reflected no share repurchases through year-
end 2020.
